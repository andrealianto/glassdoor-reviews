# Glassdoor Reviews

_May 2019_

## Overview
Glassdoor is a website where employees can anonymously review the companies they work for. Glassdoor is a great resource for job seekers; it gives an insider view, the pros and the cons of working in a company.

Currently, Glassdoor allows users to see a company's overall rating, its distribution and its trend over time, as well as a company's ratings across five metrics (culture and values, work/life balance, senior management, compensation and benefits, career opportunities). It also gives users access to pages of reviews by former and current employees.

## Objective
The goal is to create a Shiny web app to compare the reviews for two companies. The app will compare:
1. Distribution of ratings
2. Rating trend across time 
3. Commonly mentioned words from positive and negative reviews

## Project Details
For the prototype, the app only focuses on market research companies:
1. AC Nielsen
2. Kantar Worldpanel
3. Euromonitor International
4. GfK
5. Millward Brown
6. Mintel
7. TNS Global

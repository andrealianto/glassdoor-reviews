- Incompetent and unqualified management. They are in their position only because they joined the company ages ago and have nowhere else to go. They have no real work other than writing long e-mails, staring at others’ schedule, and scheduling meeting so that they could feel like they have something to do. Some of them do not …  even know how to do the simple task we are all doing.
- Questionable products. The methodology is outdated and the company has no intention to make its products better. The management even says to you that you do not have to work hard to create a good product. Instead, they want you to chat with them and spend more time with them so that they feel like they are doing something in the office.
- Power harassment. The management tries its best to crush you once you notice they are the least competent ones in the office and stop being their cheerleader. Because the HR function is nonexistent in practice, there is nowhere for employees to turn to.
- Lack of investment in business tools. Some services are worth paying money for. We should not rely everything on free web services.
- Lack of self-awareness. The company is very inward-looking. The management keeps telling everyone how great the company is, despite the negative feedback we receive from client every day. The so-called trainings are also all done by your colleagues who joined a couple of years before you. The company doesn’t believe in learning from external parties or even from competitors.
- Office environment. The office is clumped. Hot desking is mandatory and it makes it very difficult to find a seat every day because you are only allowed to work from home on certain conditions. We waste time adjusting everything from a seat to a display every day, then the same amount of time packing everything up. There’s no space to do any critical thinking, and this is a research company!
- High turnover rate. But actually it’s a good because it’s always talented people who leave. They shouldn’t waste time here. Hot desking is perfect in not noticing high turnover because you don’t really notice how many people are leaving the place every month.
- Inflexible hours. You have to be in the office 9 hrs every day.
- Lack of leave days
- No 401k or any other retirement plan (everyone usually leaves in 1-2 years so not needed?)Show More","- Remove the management. Hire competent and trained managers from outside.

2. HR department- The department is always helping us out with anything, related to the employees. They are …  both caring and strict in terms of the manual of policies laid down by Euromonitor.
3. Growing firm: The company is growing. This growth is not expected to be short-lived but a long one.
4. Learning opportunities: If you want to learn something, be it visualization tools, advanced excel, report writing, etc., this is the place to be. The managers and seniors are well-equipped to build the learning environment required to sustain an individual's growth.
5. Senior leaders from outside India: They will come and will mingle with you all the time, from playing football to parties. You won't feel once that the person has 20 years of work-experience and is 5-6 levels above you. Interacting with them is enthralling.
6. Fun environment- The environment was really good most of the times, where you could enjoy yourself.
7. Top peers: All your peers are hand-picked and scrutinized after number of rounds of interview, you will understand that by working with them. Everyone will bring something on the table.Show More","This is the really hard part. We need to understand the following points happen almost everywhere and since the company is growing in Bengaluru, it will surely overcome the deficiencies:

1. Vision for employees: sometimes there is a lack of mention of what personal career trajectory we would be on in the future. This will be addressed, I am sure in the future, as the top management has taken note of it.
2. …  Small level bias: There are little bias between few team members, which needs to be cut at the nascent stage. Although, I can assure you this is not as prominent as in some other organization. Its just few people have stayed together for too long and they feel that their growth was related to those people, hence there is a strong bond between them, which at some time can come in between meritocracy or fair treatment.
3. Nothing else- It is an awesome place to work!Show More","These are my personal suggestions:

1. Lay down a plan for an employee progress uniformly in front of the entire workforce. It shouldn't be verbal! It should be consistent across time and people.
2. Money is important for us! We need that to be considered in our progress. The current starting salary is quite competitive but we need to be clear how the organization will improve on those based on our …  performance.

1. If you are considering a career in research, Euromonitor can be a very good learning ground for you.

2. …  A good brand name to have on your CV.

3. The exposure you get will help you gain expertise early in your career.

4. Very interesting work.

5. Good support from the HR and administration. They are actually the most professional of the lot.

6. Their offices are usually in the state of the art buildings which have most of the facilities close by.Show More","1. Most managers like playing favorites. If you are someone who can always be at the beck and call of your manager even at your own inconvenience, you have better chances at growing. If you’re a flatterer, this is the place for you!

2. People (this includes most managers and most peers) judge too soon. If you were new to this job and took some time to learn, they’ve already written you off. The mistakes you …  made in the early months at your job will always be amplified and your victories (especially good feedback from the client) will be completely ignored.

3. Taking sick leaves is a sin. Taking more than 7 sick leaves is looked down upon. This not only difficult if you’re going through a medical crisis but also worse if you have to take care of people in your family.

4. Very poor pay and negligible bonus. Managers will usually give you most obnoxious reasons for not giving a hike. “Remember that mistake you made a year back?”

5. The work hours are crazy. If you put your foot down, you might be pulling off long hours at least 3 days a week.

6. They don’t have a good training system in place which is too bad, because they expect you to be a thorough professional from day 1.

7. Previous experience of people is almost discounted. People are not treated respectfully especially the senior ones.

8. Management likes to treat only those people well who try very hard to always stay visible. If you’re someone who likes to lay low, chances are you’ll be ignored. Out of sight, out of mind.

9. Some seniors managers are passive aggressive, you’ll never know when you’ve ticked them off and they might not even give you a chance to correct your mistake.

10. High attrition in the past years. Apart from the old folks, the most newbies don’t think it’s worth sticking it out here. Many people have quit within their first 2 years.Show More","Management needs to seriously get some perspective and preferably an attitude change.

Be a little more human towards those who have real issues.

2. The leadership doesn't respect the local culture by ""helicopter in"" managers from other offices and run Singapore office thinking that we should be like ""the office they came from"".
3. A disempowering …  environment for managers. As an individual contributor, you can still make some decisions IF you have a supportive manager.

Processes tend to be very ambiguous and confusing when you are new.

- There is a lot of talk of putting change into place, and too often were meetings held internally to have nothing concrete come out of it. By the time some form of change was attempted, countless number of people were extremely unhappy and have decided to take the high road out of here
- Have seen on many occasions …  where management has been lazy, pushing their responsibility to junior positions to make their personal jobs easier. Doesn't set a good example, especially to the newer employees

Poor synergy between departments
- Departments generally do not gel well with each other, and there are several occasions where animosity is developed from colleagues feeding each other incorrect information just to take the easy and convenient way out
- Doesn't feel like colleagues are generally supportive of each other's growth in the company, keeping closely to their own KPIs

Cold and unmotivated culture
- Colleagues generally look lifeless coming into work, and I've rarely witnessed anyone genuinely upbeat or happy in a span of more than a year
- Office can be dead quiet at times
- General vibe is that this company attracts largely unmotivated (except for a rare few) people

Questionable data
- With the current methodology employed and remains core to the company, the data gathered remains highly questionable and to a large extent, highly unreliable

Uncompetitive salary
- In today's day and age, the compensation + benefits provided by the company is severely lacking

Turnover Rate
- Turnover rate is CRAZY, retention rate is barely over 60% and it says a lot about how much people value their time in this company
- There are tons of better companies out there, the only saving grace (and reason many have chose to stay) is the brand name (Which will go downhill soon if the methodology is not improved)

Low pay compared to the industry average but very reasonable working hours","Sales Leadership:
Sellers are overwhelmed by the internal complexity of their jobs. The company has finally increased sales support resources in the last few years, but the execution and timing were appalling. More support means sellers must process more information, involve more internal stakeholders, and engage with more technological touchpoints. Sales reps either ignore it or are forced to make trade-offs and …  this increases the cost of sales, places pressure on margins and raises cycle times.

Feedback from reps or mid-management is hardly ever taken into consideration, which increases friction and staff turn-over. Middle managers have no real influence or autonomy, never achieve over-inflated targets and often earn peanuts compared to reps. A great example is ABC team - have they got any managers left?

No transparency and eroding corporate culture. This is predominantly driven by several factors:

CEO's focus has shifted from taking the existing business to new levels of growth to new product development. Strategic and operational priorities were left in the hands of highly incompetent people with personal agendas.

No real senior executive accountability.

VPs of sales are mostly focused on expanding their areas of influence whether through assuming more responsibilities or promoting their loyalists to positions of influence. This means that the company suffers not only from inefficiencies in decision making, it tampers with business growth prospects, successful delivery of overarching growth strategy and erodes what's once was a great corporate culture. It also stops talented people being promoted to lead important business functions.

Although career development strategy has been rolled out, many roles have been created which aren't necessary. People don't take this seriously because a change in your job title with no alteration in responsibilities isn't growth or development. Meritocracy principles need to be introduced.
 Stop favoritism and sexism - this is clearly evident through official salary reporting and general sentiment in the organisation.Show More","Note to owners - if you do wish to see your business grow and return to being one of the best companies to work for, you need to seriously consider the capabilities of your sales leadership team.

- Flexible hours (employees can come in anytime from 8-10am)

To them, every employee is dispensable and they will not hesitate to get rid of people who do not adhere to what the senior management has decided upon. The white people call the shots here, we are made to listen to what London implements, and the Asians have no say. Therefore, if you want to be heard and grow with the company, please do not bother being a …  part of this circus act. Working here has made me feel like I am just pawn for them to bring in revenue for them, nothing more. You are never appreciated except through takashimaya vouchers.

Career progression here also amounts to nothing, While they have tried to create more layers within each function, the job scope per title (business development associate, executive, senior executive, consultant) remains largely the same and you end up just reaching a point where you just stop learning. It is like a retirement home - you just grow old and grow mould daily. Some people then choose to leave within a couple of years, while the alternative is to stay here for 10-15 years because you just get too comfortable.

Furthermore, one huge problem with Euromonitor is that lack of transparency and consistency. Nothing is ever consistent here - new sales initiatives get canned as quickly as they get rolled out. Nothing ever follows through, leaving sales reps entirely directionless and confused. Also, territories change every 4-5 months, and targets change as they please. Despite taking away huge markets like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea due to new offices, they raised the targets per sales person; a move that is totally illogical and frustrating. On the point of transparency, leads are also not disseminated based on territory, but on who the manager prefers. There is just so much sneaking around, hiding, covering up for less than useful sales people, which eventually leads to a lot of animosity within the teams.

From the outside, many would think that Euromonitor is a great place and a good brand in the market research industry. However, after a few months in, one would realise that instead of welcome lunches, you end up going for more farewell lunches than anything because the attrition rate is just alarmingly high. This results in terribly low morale and bad vibes all around the office, and unfortunately, the leadership team would rather just live in denial than attempt to solve it.

It is kinda hilarious that Euromonitor had initially embarked on rapid expansion plans, and it did work - we grew. But fast forward this to present day, I think more work has been done filling out the gaps with the astonishing number of people resigning. Expansion is obviously not in the horizon anymore. It is especially a shame because the product and service is really one that adds value to the industry.Show More","Listen to the people on the ground when they are actually complaining and pushing changes, because once they stop complaining, you have lost their loyalty and trust, and they are just going to leave.

Management supports this practice and implements it themselves.","Imagine sitting down to play chess in a park. Now imagine your opponent is a pigeon. The pigeon lands on the chess board and stares stupidly at you. It then knocks some pieces over with its tail, takes a dump on the board, pecks randomly at nothing in particular, and all the while doing this struts around like it is doing something very impressive.

This is Euromonitor management.

Management insulates …  themselves from any and all outside evaluation. Most managers lack any sort of skill that would qualify them to successfully lead people. Ethics are malleable, especially when it comes to reporting KPIs. Sales reps will dial fax numbers and hang up to satisfy daily dials requirements. Management will undercut their own reps' deals if there is a better outcome to be had for themselves. Infighting between teams over sales deals is the norm.

Pay is very low as evidenced by hyper-turnover. All other competitors have higher pay and easily poach reps who are already unhappy. The only people comfortable with staying are typically married and only need secondary income, don't have aspirations of learning skills or advancing, and the 22-25yr olds that have no basis of comparison of what normally functioning companies look like.

When the plan to aggressively increase sales headcount was implemented, salary offerings were lowered. As a result, quality of hires dipped significantly. Over the period of two years, the average sales rep went from trusted client adviser and subject matter expert to greasy used car salesman. A capable CEO would have foreseen this outcome as inevitable.

The are no shortcuts. The organic growth was there and the company was in a very good place a few years ago. Now the knowledge base that led that growth have all left. The Golden Goose has been killed and the extra eggs we got in the process turned out to be turds.Show More","Just take the first step and realize that yes, it is possible that what I have said is true.

The office culture and processes are built so that you really have to learn all aspects of the business in order to be successful there. This makes it a great learning opportunity to translate into future employment elsewhere.

Despite all the cons, it seems like management in the Chicago office anyway may …  finally be starting to wake up and realize that they need to listen to their employees. They've started a training program of sorts and have started doing internal surveys for feedback on what they can improve. It's a start.Show More","The company is not consistent with allowing some people to have a flexible work environment, but not everyone.

Do not make exceptions for some individuals but not for others, and especially do not make exceptions for management but not for lower employees.

Don't expect any clear structure or policies.

This place is definitely not a meritocracy either. Don't expect surpassing your goals to earn you any credibility. They are looking for ""yes"" people here.

Over the course of almost 5 years, the structure was changed in some way every single year. They seem more concerned with trying some new internal organizational structure than with hiring the right people for the right jobs and training and motivating them well.

It absolutely never bothered me that there's high turnover in sales, as I see this as a normal part of the profession. What does bother me a lot, though, is the insane amount of turnover in the syndicated and custom research teams. Not only have pretty much all the experienced people left, but they hire in entry level analysts who have no idea what they are doing and then don't properly train them. This has directly resulted in clients questioning the credibility of our syndicated research. Custom research projects have gone so badly that long standing clients demand refunds, and the rest of us are left apologizing and trying to convince the client that it's the exception rather than the unfortunate rule nowadays. Then management gets on our cases for not making enough sales.Show More","Be more worried about hiring, developing, and keeping great staff behind the core research offerings.

For the most part, the office is filled with smart, fun and engaging people which makes for a pretty decent atmosphere. Euromonitor is a growing company with a fairly good product which is a definite plus.

Advancement - Early in your career it is all about moving up and, for the size of the company, there is actually some opportunity. You may not get a huge new title, …  but they do make people “Senior” and that sort of thing. I am not sure what people expect when entering an organization of this size, but there are not going to be layers and layers of management to move into.

Benefits (not really a pro or a con) - The 401k has a 3% match, very standard with other places. Health insurance got less expensive this year. The PPO is still pricey but covers almost everything. Do people see the headlines and read about what is happening with healthcare in this country? 15 vacation days to start, above average compared to other places I worked. Started pre-tax transit this year (finally), big plus. I have seen better benefits at smaller companies and worse benefits at larger companies. It all depends what you compare it to. Euromonitor is not Google or Yahoo and to compare the benefits to those companies is just silly. Could the benefits be better? Absolutely! They just need to spend more money! But many, many companies seems to be in cost-containment and cost-sharing mode with benefits these days.

Events, etc - Company events and parties are better than average. The summer event is held on a week day and you go there instead of the office (first time I have ever seen this and it is great). Fresh fruit every week, good coffee, beautiful office, quarterly-ish happy hours. The policies for travel, expenses, office, etc, are not remarkably better or worse than any place out there.Show More","Leadership - Senior leaders (ie London management and owners) do not seem to provide any long term vision for the organization. They try to disguise this by saying we are an ""entrepreneurial"" company but in reality that is no longer true. By nature, a mid-size company like Euromonitor needs objectives, strategy and vision with budget, resources, plans and systems to support these efforts. Ideally, this would be …  accompanied by charisma and leadership. Local managers in Chicago try - some have awkward or unfortunate personalities and some are restrained by the owners/senior management - but it’s not like they are bad or evil people. Working in any privately-owned company you are subject to the whim of the owner(s). Honestly, the ownership can be a bit odd, not employee-friendly, make things unnecessarily difficult, and get in the way of progress, but why not focus on your job and what you can do rather than things out of your control?

Salary - Salary is on the low end of adequate and they need to take a serious look at adding a real bonus program for non-commission people. The minimal bonus (1-2%) at Christmas is really not motivating and seems cheap when the company is doing well. It would be smarter to put something variable in place tied to the company's success or create a bonus pool to distribute based on merit. I suspect when the economy improves, Euromonitor will find that people can and will leave to earn more money elsewhere.Show More","In general - Make sure your expectations of any organization are realistic. And if you are unhappy (wherever you are) then do something to try to change it or put your efforts into finding a new job. Learn everything that you can and use your position as a stepping stone in your career - that is all any job is. Euromonitor may not be a place you stay for 20 years, but what company is these days? If you can't find …  something better, maybe it is time to look at yourself in this equation rather than blaming everything on the company. No company is all good or all bad. And it is also crazy to assume that every post which is not entirely negative is from management.

I’m on the sales team and I get to have interesting conversations with executives in some of the biggest and most progressive companies in the world. I work across multiple levels and functions so get to work with a lot of different people in those companies.

-Excellent work/life balance. Overall people in this office tend to work very reasonable hours (9-5), especially compared to other …  professional services firms. There are teams, specifically the research teams, that do have weeks where they work long hours but in general the hours promote a strong work/life balance. Additionally there is no “blackberry” culture here. Managers don’t expect you to be responsive to their emails in the evenings and on the weekends. In fact, many employees don’t even have their work email on their phones.

-Generous incentive package. I’ve been in a commission-based role for the past 7 years and this is one of the best plans I’ve seen. Commissions are paid out monthly and the annual targets are reasonable. Commissions are also uncapped; at goal you can double your salary but you could triple your salary if you had a good year.

-Smart, nice and worldly colleagues. It’s almost just as common to hear non-English languages being spoken in the office as it is to hear English. The people here are incredibly smart but not just book-smart. Most people have lived abroad, many speak multiple languages and it seems like everyone here has these incredibly interesting hobbies on top of their work life. I enjoy coming into the office.

-Ability to set your own travel schedule. Though as sales people we do travel, and though managers will push you to see clients, you have a lot of authority on when and where you travel. I’ve read reviews on this site that talk about how much travel is involved in the role and I have to strongly disagree with those comments. The average person probably travels once every 4-6 weeks and the heaviest travelers are on the road every 1.5 weeks.

-The local leadership team that promotes a casual and open office culture. There isn’t a strong feeling of a hierarchy here and people are allowed to be themselves in the office. We have a lot of kooky personalities at Euromonitor but that’s one of the things I like best about our office.Show More","-The benefits package isn't good compared to other companies I've worked for. We are a small company and I don’t expect the same type of benefits I got at large companies, but, if I’m honest, they’ve cut too much. The health plan is expensive on an individual basis and impossibly expensive to have a family on the plan. Additionally the company has chosen not to offer domestic partnership plans.

-The base …  salaries are lower than other professional sales roles. That said, for people in sales roles the take-home pay can be amazing if you’re doing well on your incentive plans.

-Euromonitor grew so quickly yet roles and responsibilities were never re-considered after we went from a small to a medium-sized business. There is confusion on who owns what and this can sometimes lead to contentious relationships with your peers. There is an organized effort right now to clarify roles so we’re moving in the right direction.

-Lack of a long-term upward career path for those that want it. Though the company has developed “Senior” titles within existing roles and “Team Lead” positions there is a lack of clarity on who gets these jobs and why. It seems like people are being promoted as a reward for tenure or for revenue generation rather than overall performance which includes creating positive internal relationships and demonstrating leadership ability (the latter being especially important for “Team Lead” positions which require you to manage).

-The global leadership team is disconnected from the Chicago office and when they do connect into the team they don't promote a positive work environment. We don’t hear anything from our London-based leadership team on a regular basis. When they do come to town, they don’t make a huge effort to get to know the staff or even interact with the staff. Interactions are often contentious and you often walk away feeling insulted and disposable (this is the case no matter how well you’re performing). That said, these interactions happen only a few times a year as the global leadership team rarely makes it to Chicago, and since the local leadership team is nice, the negative feelings about management are short-lived.

-Euromonitor has a terrible charitable giving policy. Despite the fact that many of the employees work for non-profits or sit on non-profit boards, the company doesn’t seem interested in charitable giving.Show More","Local management does a great job of keeping a casual work environment but I think they could do more to promote cross-team collaboration. In the recent months it has become clear that the local management team is putting more effort into recognizing strong performers and keeping everyone informed of company strategy. That said, there's still some room for improvement. I would also highly suggest re-evaluating the …  health insurance/benefits package. Many employees are at the stage in life where they are about to start families and our health insurance plan makes that difficult. If you want employees to stay and grow with Euromonitor our insurance needs to be able to support that growth and promote tenure.

My suggestion to the global leadership team would be to establish more of a positive presence with the Chicago office. I think “face time” with the team here could go a long way and could make us feel connected and appreciated. That said, the “face time” has to be positive and I think that team needs to make an effort to show their appreciation for the staff. Staff outings and dinners don’t mean anything if, during the dinner, you insult us or make us feel disposable.

Finally, I hope management keeps all the good things they've already put in place. Keep the incentive plans, keep the work/life balance, keep hiring smart and interesting people, and (though this will become more difficult as we grow) try to continue to give employees a balance between structure and autonomy.Show More"

Commission is flat. Yes it's a decent number. However commission is based off of numerous factors like if the client …  is a new client or a renewing clients. Renewing clients aren't worth anything. And commission payout assumes you've met target, however meeting target is more challenging when it's based off clients being new, not renewed. Over all, commission structure changes based on company structure - so you can agree to one thing when you are hired, then get another when they change how they do commission or sales. Which happens.

Management is becoming less competent, rather than more, and I don't know how that happens.

Certain managers need serious anger management, and are liabilities. Yet, they still have jobs, that is because the company does not value employees.

This company, really shouldn't even have it's doors open at this point. Other than people enjoying some work invented friendships, there is nothing else here, the product isn't well respected.

The company has had turn over every month (however, it's a small company and turn over shouldn't be as bad as it is), and the company seems either ignorant or indifferent that many of us are trying to save our careers and self happiness - by leaving.Show More","Please consider the style you manage people, and be consistent.

Like all great empires, byzantine internal bureaucracy and arrogance around the need to change ultimately leads to being slow to adapt to a dynamic, brave new world.

In a desperate attempt to steer the titanic away from the iceberg the Research side of the business has been sold to Ipsos in pursuit of “digital”. Although no one seems to know what …  “digital” is. A lot of buzz words and execuspeak flying around.

Kafkaesque finance and proposal system makes adapting to fast changing market impossible and frustrating.

Teams seem to lack motivation and good management.

Good, young talent is leaving the business in droves due to extremely poor salaries compared to market competitors. Management doesn’t even seem to try and make people stay.

Non-existent promotion and career structures

Clients feel they have to use GfK instead of wanting to use them. External consultancy has proved this.

Years of over exposure and rigid workers councils in Germany have bled the company dry and made it impossible to adapt.

Ping pong table is annoying especially when you trying to concentrate. Tap tap tap!Show More","Good luck with the Ipsos buyout of the traditional Research business and I hope the “digital” transformation is a success.

Get better at defining what the “digital” transformation is. A lot of people genuinely don’t understand what you are trying to achieve here.

The intelligence and commitment of your staff is paramount, start paying them more and provide a better benefit package. A lot of your …  competitors are easily steeling your homegrown talent by offering substantial pay increases, “wellness” programs and ping pong tables really don’t cut it with millennials. We need more money to live!

If you want to be more “dynamic” cut back on the bureaucracy and make it easier for people to win business and acquire talent quickly (prospecting job candidates won’t wait around for you - make offers quickly).

I read a Glassdoor article titled, ""7 Types of Companies You Should Never Work For"" and GfK meets almost every one of these types - high turnover, poor company culture, top heavy business, perpetual promiser, stagnator, and directionless ship

High turnover - half of my team has recently left the company and they can't …  backfill them fast enough. They are losing all of that institutional knowledge and the remaining team is desperately understaffed and under-resourced. The leadership's response is to blame the people that left.

Culture - the team culture is dictated by our senior leader, who is the most disrespectful and unprofessional person I have ever met. The whole team walks on eggshells wondering when the next tantrum is coming and who's going to be the next punching bag. She consistently bad mouths customers and employees, is extremely two-faced and lashes out at people. She leads a global team and yet somehow micromanages every single person on the team. Other leaders on the team are too scared to stand up to her and support their reports. When voicing my concerns, I've been told ""that's just how she is"" - this defines our team culture. Multiple people have left due to her behavior.

Top heavy business - 1/3 of the team are executive level leadership, and the rest are individual contributors. I report up to multiple executives - why is there no middle management? I am responsible to all of them and to do all their bidding, and yet none of them are responsible to me. I get little to no mentorship or support and am constantly pulled in different directions.

Perpetual promiser - I was promised a raise and a promotion and therefore given a lot more responsibility, but told many excuses like needing to wait for budgeting or timing, etc. It's been months and NO raise and promotion is in sight. I have lost all faith and trust in this company. I'm certain others in our team have heard these empty promises to keep everyone from jumping ship. This applies to customers as well. This is a sales-driven company, and leaders will do and say anything to land a deal. The team is understaffed and our processes are broken, and I would be concerned about what GfK is actually capable of delivering. Garbage in, garbage out.

Stagnant - there are very few growth or learning opportunities here. My only option is looking into GfK's e-learning community, but it's self service, hard to navigate, and essentially just reading outdated slides. The whole team is so understaffed that there is just no time or room for growth - only just enough time to try to put out fires and get to the next day.

Directionless - self explanatory. If you're looking for a successful, mission-driven company, this isn't it. If you ask anyone on the team what GfK's mission or values are, you would just get blank stares.Show More","If your team is leaving in droves, stop blaming them and look in the mirror. Employees are the driving force of GfK and deserve to be respected and recognized for their hard work. You can only lead through fear and terror for so long."

Do what you do best- basic data by nice people. That's ok- not every company needs to be the rock star. Don't expect nice people who have been doing the …  same work for 15 years to turn around and do something completely different and out of their element. Be honest. Let people play to their strengths. Everyone seems stretched currently trying to make up for lack of basic infrastructure and skills at the company.

Stop going on about passion and innovation. Stop trying to compete in an arena where you weren't even invited to play. All you end up with is a high turnover because people see the lies and leave. You're not fooling your clients either.

They are flexible on time, one of the only thing GfKMRI management have to work with since everything else has been stripped away from them. If you have been with company a few years you can ask for a work from home day a week. But don't expect that in your first year.","Ever since they moved GfKRMI and the sister companies to its new location at 200 Liberty St in Battery Park things have been going down hill. GfK imposed a 40 hour work week from our previous 35 hour work week and no salary compensation was made, they got 5 hours a week out of us for free. They took away some personal days, the summer days you read by another reviewer here are now gone after 2013, the 401k match has …  dropped to 3% if you put in 6%, they moved us to an area of Manhattan that has been attacked by terrorists twice, under water & with out electricity and mass transit for a week from a Super Storm and now in a constant state of construction for at least the next 10 years. It dusty, crowded and noisy, ya it Manhattan but this is more so than the rest of the island. for at least 90% of the staff it added 30 additional minutes in each direction on to our commutes. And lunch is very expensive in this area with Wall St. near by. The office space themselves are cramped, all open space cubes, we went from 65% having offices to less than 12% having offices. The bathrooms are a mess, they cut down on cleaning services and put us into a location with more people but less toilets. If you're not done with your ""business"" before 12pm good luck, because there is probably no toilet paper left OR there is crap (no pun) all over the place. This is partly because of a few idiots working here I know but it is also the first sign of a disgruntled staff, no cameras in bathroom so they strike out against the company in there. O ya, they water down the hand soap, it is effectively all water, not kidding pretty sad.

And yes, the politics crap you read from the other reviewers, they are still here but then again its like that anywhere you go so I really don't ding GfKMRI for that. Just learn to play the game.

Last but not least, if you have any desires to work hard and be recognized for your efforts with bonuses and promotions, this is NOT the place for you. There are people here who are on there 15+ anniversary with this company and have the same title as when they started. A VERY small handful of staff get promoted and the reason is there is no room for promotion here. Other note, they love to keep head count low here at GfKMRI, so as employees tend to leave its not uncommon to see the position be split up and assigned to others as ""temporary"" until they replace the position and low and behold the position never gets filled and you have done such a great job of taking on the new work that it is now part of your daily duties, with no pay increase.

If after all that, you do decide to work here, do yourself a favor keep it to no more than 3 years before you leave.Show More","This is more to the GfK North America & Nuremberg (HQ) management than the GfKMRI management as GfKMRI folks have been effectively castrated from any abilities to help there employees and its by design from the GfK North America Managers. Stop expecting blood from a stone, GfKMRI is your most profitable and productive entity in your portfolio of companies in North America, give them a break. If you keep bleeding …  them you will be left with a shell of a company as all your best staff jump like rats on a sinking ship. Look at your non-profitable entities and try to right them to bring up profits, or if they are not fixable do the right thing and cull them. Although you show all the signs of not caring a bit about your staff, but if you care about revenue & profit and we know that's all you you do care about, then ease up or you lose.

Also, Kathi Love is NOT the CEO here anymore, she left in Feb 2013 after 13 successful years with the company as CEO. There is no more CEO position anymore, it has been replaced by a Managing Director role which is held by Florian Kahlert, who it would seem has a closed door policy and just about never comes out of his office to talk to anyone.Show More"

Overall, the majority of people who work for the company are young.","Sadly, not everyone can work in these teams, therefore most options for career progression are limited and you end up being just a cog in the machine churning data analyses like nobody's business. The churn rate must be pretty substantial as the floor I worked on got pretty empty at some point despite top management saying 'our churn is not higher than other agencies' churn' when asked the direct …  question.

Another cons is there are too much red tape and a ridiculous structure in terms of the promotion process relative to what the company offers in return, e.g. one of the many hoops to jump through to get promoted even at the graduate level is the typical company politics, however, you end up presenting 'a recent piece of work' to the board, who pretend to be a client, as a final stage. Needless to say, the board has many members with 15+ years worth of experience some of whom take great pleasure in grilling you like no client would.

If/when you get promoted your responsibilities actually won't really change - what you were doing the last year or more will be the same, and the pay increase is so minimal that you'd rather give the money back and not go through the entire promotion process at all. This process repeats with minor differences throughout your career, which means career progression is pretty slow and arduous on average (as per usual, some people are better at company politics than others).

Lastly, the office location could not be much worse than Hanger Lane, but I appreciate it renders a very low fixed cost as the company owns the bunker building.Show More","Stop viewing everyone but yourselves as replaceable and focus more on doing the right things by finding ways to simplify the promotion process and increase salaries, thus you may retain and get more value out of the experienced staff and cut overall costs by not having to attract and train new personnel constantly."

The MD sets a great tone and is one of the most approachable people in the business and you can tell he is genuine. Good training as a graduate and a clear mapped out development path. Industry leader in panel insights in FMCG so you'll be working with some top clients.

The office environment is easy going and there's a strong identity. Commercially the …  business does well and looks set to continue in this fashion in the foreseeable future.

There are some really great managers in the business and the FMCG products are as good as it gets in the continuous panel arena.

Solid company benefits available once at a certain level. Training is really good, so you'll leave Worldpanel with some great sought after skills.

Overall, you won't come across many companies like this one.Show More","The office location isn't ideal. The pay scales need revamping. Pay bands are very much below the market average and the gap grows the further up the food chain you go. Pay is also inconsistent across teams and there's no clear guidance on what you can expect at each level.

Movement to other Kantar agencies isn't really promoted as much as it should and movements to other teams within the company is promoted …  at the corporate level but still yet to be fluid as you'd like to see.

Beyond the graduate academy set up, individual career development is more of an after thought for the business. Senior management not measured on staff development. Many managers are more than happy to lose good people as there is little appetite to retain someone in the wider business if they have outgrown their immediate role. Many roles are advertised but often it's already been decided who will get that role. If your business unit is growing and the unit leader likes you, your growth could be accommodated. If that's not the case, then you may struggle and a large part of this depends on luck as to which business unit you end up in or start in.

Company perks are largely focussed around funding social nights out or free drinks but it is a poor long term incentive and feels very much like a cheap alternative to a real rewards structure as the novelty wears off after a few years of this. The graduate pay is pretty bad to begin with as well compared to London rates. Very hard to get up and running if you're coming to London and this is your first job.

Many senior managers have gained management responsibilities through tenure and their own rises through the company and some are ill equipped to actually manage well. There are many great managers but it's open to luck. Business has tried to address this but the main focus is on the commercials, so things like this often take a back seat.

Strong sentiment of secrecy creeping in. Elements of cliques coming in at high levels in the business where things are decided in an opaque manner and then communicated to the rest of the business. If you're in that crowd you'll do well but if you're not then you may find your career hits a ceiling.

Office has a great atmosphere but at times it lacks a professional environment. Lots of office politics and gossip and 'inappropriate' behaviour between colleagues on a work night out is pretty much the norm, from very senior staff too, which I think sets a bad example and can create conflicts of interests if senior members engage in such behaviours with more junior staff.

The company offers some good benefits but certain key elements only kick in at a certain level. For example the bonus scheme only applies to client managers and above with the same being true for health insurance, which will leave you feeling undervalued at certain levels.

Kantar, part of WPP, the overarching brand in which Worldpanel sits has largely left it alone to operate as it has done but that is beginning to change, some of it for the good but in reality this can often have day to day implications on hiring policy, pay rises, promotion frameworks, equitable appraisals and incentive & bonus schemes.

In terms of developing the product, the ideas coming out are good but are implemented at a very slow pace. Operationally the business is moving in a cost cutting direction or looking for 'efficiencies' and resource for developing products is always under severe strain. Other agencies are more driven in the pace at which they move.Show More","Continue with the direction of the company in terms of growth. Invest more in people, in what you pay to retain good loyal staff. Behave as you aspire to be as a business in the conduct around the office and with clients, with senior management setting the tone. Need to set clear boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour between colleagues and what is proper conduct to ensure there is no conflict of interests if …  staff members begin personal relationships.

Top down hierarchical management and unrealistic company targets contribute to perpetual negative office vibes evidenced by tears, stress and late night working, followed inevitably by all too familiar announcements of departures.

Seniors have become experienced 'schooling' fresh out of Uni …  grads, taking delight at pointing out minor mistakes etc. Expect to be treated as such regardless of your age and experience.
With a general lack of experience knowledge is power at MB. Those that have it tend to hoard it, pointing to the companies online portal as a way to self educate around working commitments.

With focus placed on retaining those schooled in the very specific MB way of doing things the company focusses efforts on retaining 'shooting star' grads. With most of the work mundane / routine / formulaic there is definitely a personality that seems to progress well - bolshy, aggressive, keen to assert and of course willing to work late evenings on a continual basis.

Work-wise there is an almost complete lack of intellectual stimulation, with an offer that is almost entirely product led and process driven (almost ripe for pure automation with in some cases dumbed down report 'insights' cut copied and pasted from templates into presentations).
MB is perhaps one of the last remaining MR agencies to produce old school 150+ page reports, often farmed out to agency partners in Eastern Europe (the unsung heroes of MB).

To underline just how poor the company is when it comes to recruitment and retention new members simply get recruited, then allocated to teams without having met team members. There is little consideration with regards to skill set, sector experience, career ambitions or indeed personality, bodies are whizzed the interview process to plug gaps in the leaky ship.

Another bone of contention is lack of discretion over clients allocation. MB's client base includes tobacco clients selling cigarettes to people in developing markets. Unfortunately, unlike some other companies you don't get a say at MB. It made my skin crawl. I seriously hope these people sleep at night.

I think it’s fair to say that my experience of MB was not entirely positive ;)

There are plenty of smaller agencies offering the opportunity for a better a work-life balance, working with nicer staff, with greater opportunity for freedom of thought.

If you are actually considering make sure you do your homework, request to meet team members before you join, reach out to former employees, ask plenty of questions, and judge for yourself.Show More","Remember this is a people business.

-Company offers healthcare benefits (albeit with high deductibles).
-Company offers a 401k plan with okay matching.
-Free coffee.","For the 'churn and burn employee':

-No raises or cost of living increases, company-wide, in the past 7 years for non-senior management employees.
-Politics, politics, and more politics. Unless you're 'in' with the 'in crowd' you can expect to be passed up for promotions or advancement, every time. Part of 'being in' is agreeing to drink the Kool-Ade ideology which is destroying the competitiveness of the …  company.
-Your manager determines your fate, not you. Get stuck with an unpopular manager and you can expect to go nowhere fast.
-Attempting to expand your role by taking on new responsibilities will only hurt you. People in other departments are protective of what they do and will see you as a threat; well established inter-departmental combativeness promotes an 'us vs. them' mentality within the organization.
-Most departments are isolated, with upper management completely clueless to redundancies or even the basic purpose of some departments. As such, some tasks are assigned to the incorrect resources.
-Hard work goes unnoticed and any accolades go to your department head or VP, not you.
-Employee recognition is virtually nonexistent and unrewarding.
-Employees are expected to work long hours with little to no basic compensation for extra work/consistently staying late.
-Pay range is low for the industry.
-Employees are treated as liabilities based on simple metrics. In essence, you're nothing more than a set of numbers, and you are treated as such, especially over time.
-Job security is non-existent. Employee purges regularly occur every 36-48 months on average, culminating usually during Q2.
-New employees can expect quick burnout due to inadequate staffing levels and high stress caused by massive workloads coupled with inadequate training.
-No incentive for employees to go above and beyond the call of duty; instead, great amounts of energy go into protecting one's job for fear of being let go at a moment's notice.
-No incentive, no advancement, no meaningful training, no recognition, no raises or bonuses, no professional growth = a very high rate of turnover. Go figure.

For the company:

-Extremely out of touch, secretive and arrogant leadership at the most senior management levels.
-Middle managers and team leaders (the employees who actually do the work) are often ill prepared to handle direct reports and have no formal management training. They typically also do not collaborate with other managers or team leaders, so no shared learning occurs.
-A stunning lack of industry innovation on virtually every level of the business, years behind many smaller, more nimble competitors.
-An equally stunning lack of information security permeates the company.
-Technology infrastructure is job none; the average employee uses desktop equipment that is well over 4 years old and largely unsupported. Network resources are abysmal, with absolutely no thought put into fixing basic access issues, adding much needed drive space or updating server infrastructure.
-MB uses a business model that is fundamentally broken despite being rebooted (with much fanfare) 3 times in the last 15 years.
-MB off shores US jobs to inferior India-based companies that have higher turnover rates than onshore MB itself.
-Seniority is a very, very negative thing at MB. The longer you're with the company, the larger the bull's-eye is painted on the back of your head for termination.
-MB HR is hostile towards employees who are lower than director level and only engage regular employees if they are not performing well or about to be fired.
-MB HR is also inept at performing the most basic roles expected of HR in a large company. Ask a question about benefits and expect to be sent to a third party website or be handed a basic slick sheet.
-Upper and senior management is unbelievably disconnected from the average employee and doesn't have any idea as to how most departments operate in the day-to-day environment that they themselves have created.
-The results of internal all-company surveys are often flat-out ignored by senior management; employee advice falls on deaf ears, no matter how loud or often it is given or how sensible and practical the outcry may be. As a result, senior management comes off as pompous and arrogant as well as out of touch with the basic realities of running an effective company.
-The company culture has turned overtly negative over the past several years, pitting the 'haves' against the 'have-nots' (meaning virtually anyone who isn't director level or above--and HR is the police force that ensures this unjust company hierarchy remains intact). As a result, employee morale remains at a disastrously low level and has begun negatively affecting client relationships. Yet, MB continues to strive in establishing itself as a 'premium brand' and therefore justify higher costs for relatively poor services and overall value.

In essence, MB was once a great company that cared about its employees but now seeks to liquidate as many positions as possible while still somehow turning a profit. The only real opportunity belongs to those employees who can consider themselves part of the 'protected elite'. The average employee remains an inconvenient necessity and a means to an end, for the time being.

So, if you are fresh out of college, full of energy and want to get your foot in the door of a world-wide market research company AND you believe you have the internal fortitude to handle a lot of stress and grief at low pay and with even less recognition, then by all means give MB a go. If you are an industry professional who is experienced in your field and looking for career advancement, however, then MB is nothing more than a dead-end and should be avoided at all costs.

This is clearly a company that is making a concerted effort to fail in every imaginable way, and to its credit, it is at least succeeding in that effort.

As a footnote, reviews that give this company more than 3 stars are outright lies and nothing more than thinly veiled attempts at feel-good PR which is manufactured, no doubt, by members of senior management and their HR lapdog cheerleaders. Don't buy into it.Show More","Senior management at this point can not be expected to somehow right this sinking ship of absolute disaster. The damage caused by ridiculous and at times conflicting business models over the years have taken their toll, and another reorg isn't going to solve anything. There exists only an extremely improbable chance of ever being able to bring this company back to a respectable level, let alone as a 'premium brand' …  within the industry at this point. In the meantime, the best and brightest minds will continue to flee the company in droves as fewer and fewer numbers of cheap and inexperienced labor tries to refill the already disenfranchised ranks of unmotivated employees.Show More"

Exposure to large brands
Free Coffee","Everyone has different experiences and there are many sides to the story but I would warn against working at the Norwalk MB. On my team the people had a distinctly rude and blunt personality. I was repeatedly bullied by upper management with comments such as ""Do you want to work here?"" and ""Did you even try?""( I assure you I was a strong performer with a positive review). In fact, I was even called a ""baby"" when I …  cried in front of a manager once, which is an extremely inappropriate response for a manager. Also a manager was talking to a coworker about me on a internal messages and messaged me instead, a silly mistake but none the less rude and cruel. One person on my team would keep track of my work hours and tell my boss whenever I left early even if I came in at 7:00AM in the morning (the phrase ""do you"" does not exist here- everyone is in everyone's business). Additionally, I was called a ""liar"" by upper management when I made an honest mistake and had no training and was just confused and used the wrong document as a reference. To summarize this is not a safe or welcoming environment. I would describe it as hostile and cruel.
The environment is not one you can grow in for all positions perform the same task. I equate it to being on an assembly line and you are continuously putting the muffler on a car. when you become a VP you get to polish the muffler then sell it:)
There is little learning about marketing or advertising you just learn the MB way. It is a dead end job unless you are committed to performing copy testing at MB or Ipsos for the rest of your life.
Training is minimal and happens extremely late if at all. In their job application, they promise training but in my time there I was trained once and it was after 8 months of working there.
Mangers are too busy to teach you anything. Whenever I had a meeting with my manager he would rudely make me wait while every 5 minutes he responded to emails. Again the people here do not know how to be managers and are self centered jerks.
The negative stereotype of market research personality pervades here. They are inconsiderate and not self aware but do anything to get the job done. They are not trusted advisors but instead afraid of their clients and franticly going through the motions to answer requests a soon as possible. Additionally, they do not have the knowledge of advertising to be trusted advisors.
Management is untrained and does not have leadership qualities.
If you are lower level your opinion does not matter even if you have a good idea. In this organization everyone's voice is not equal.
There is little work life balance. I often worked 12-14 hours one day of the week and worked on weekends too. Because you are working long hours your hourly pay is very low compared to if you worked only 40hrs per week.
Managers like to micromanage you because you do not have ownership of your own projects so all your work is passed off as theirs.
Rarely do you receive positive feedback or reinforcement. Their culture focuses on the negative and disciplining you so you fit their ideal. aka drink the koolaide
Work life balance and culture does depend on your client and the projects you have going on at the time. People are often overwhelmed and ask for help with very few volunteers. However I would suggest against volunteering because people there do not understand that you are helping them and will inevitably make more trouble for you. Yet they do say ""Thank you"" after they complain.
I would not say the environment is competitive because you rarely move up in a position but I would say that everyone is watching and very judgmental. Most people are extremely uptight. Everyone acts as if something is up you know where, preventing them from sitting comfortably in their desk chairs.
If you think this is an ad agency you are wrong. Though I would say the work is collaborative (but micromanaged- rarely work together work is passed down) and slightly creative it is the MB way or the highway and at a low level you are doing things the way your manager wants.
No mentorship program
Everyone is overwork and overextended that they are very focused on themselves and their tasks. For example as part of being new I had to shadow someone in another department. After 2 months of trying to arrange this because it is mandatory, the person I was supposed to shadow told me she was too busy and passed me on to someone who worked for her. People are not generous or flexible with their time.
Again everyones experience can vary but this was a true disaster of a work experience.The Cons out weigh the pros.Show More","Do not force fun to change the culture. Forced fun is not fun

Morale in the office is at an all time low with cancellation of both summer and Christmas party (quiz held in staff lounge instead) on the grounds of budget issues (senior managements lack of control throughout the year, the …  money was there at the start). From my experience staff members are actually looking for new jobs whilst at work and openly discussing new opportunities with other companies around the office.

In some teams there are not enough people on junior levels to cover the work load, whereas in others very junior trainees are expected to do work of a client manager with very little training. Work life balance is horrendous, people are regularly in the office until midnight or on the weekend, with very limited flexibility to work from home until very senior. Although they are an enormous company they don't actually provide the resources to do the job, (ie. Laptops only provides to senior employees) and getting any IT issue sorted (from India) is a complete nightmare.

The pay is average for London but for the amount of hours expected from you is very poor.

The quality of the research conducted is very poor - on numerous occasions incorrect figures in reports went out to clients, once this was discovered these mistakes were not always revealed to the clients.

Having experienced life within another research company I would not under any circumstances advise anyone to work for Millward Brown.Show More","Start valuing your staff, treat them as human beings and not just producers of money.

- Group Directors are constantly pressured to sell in view of the exceedingly red P&L. As iterated by those before me, this short term focus disregards the longer term wellbeing of this company. At monthly meetings, the top management propagates the need to keep selling to clients whilst emphasizing that times are tough. The pressure that the group directors are under make it impossible for …  them to focus on anything else other than selling, where client conversations are starting to detract from servicing the client to selling just about anything to client. The company has forgotten that forging a two way relationship will lead to long term sustainable growth.
Extraordinary Accounting
At said monthly gatherings, the financial wheel of doom and gloom is shown; mostly telling us we are on track for the year but this does not reveal the absolute dollar amount that has to be sold within the year. The actual dollar amount will not be revealed but come Oct – Dec, the targets seem not to move at all, which can be rather strange as account servicing would be pushing ahead at full throttle. Impressively, in 2014, top management constantly informed the company that we were doing very well until the time for promotions came along. It was so very peculiar! When it was time for promotions, it was as though the company timed a nosedive into the financial armpits of research. Those promoted were not given a pay raise, with a clause whereby a pay raise that commiserated with their position would be very much contingent on the company’s performance in the next 2 quarters, effectively robbing them of any well-deserved increases in base salary, AWS and bonus(pathetic if any). Impressively, as with any “regular” promotion, those promoted had all their responsibilities increased despite lack of pay increase. That is a seemingly fraudulent way of maintaining the payroll whilst getting more out of your employees if you ask me.
2015’s promotion cycle was equally frustrating; employees were also left in the dark about their upcoming promotions, pay raises and deserved adjustments until 1 day before the salary was due in our accounts (which is the deadline for finance to wire money into the bank accounts). For a company that evaluates ad communication, we sure do a shoddy job of informing our employees about their pay. Many who deserved their promotions were not able to receive anything, and they do deserve a lot better than what they are receiving now.

Questionable HR
After multiple interactions with HR, I have come to understand that they don’t give a rat’s behind about your wellbeing, your morale, and/or anything that does not make money. In fact, HR is pretty powerless and outrageously rotten. On a few occasions, my team was told that we would be receiving an additional head count just a DAY before the person was due to arrive when:

1) We did not expect any additional headcount, thus have not planned any training
2) We were delivered an headcount of a position we did not ask for, effectively killing our P&L once again
I believe that said headcount would have gone through interviews, and would have formally accepted an offer before arriving at MB’s doorstep. It would have been great if HR could let us know a week in advance for us to plan for training and account allocation but nope, client service can plan for all of that at 5.30pm at a drop of HR’s mighty email.
Effects of HR’s ludicrous hiring manifests in B-grade headcounts, where the company does little to correct the mistakes of severe incompetence. Exceedingly poor hires are allowed to continue without jurisdiction despite multiple rounds of feedback; some have even received promotions (Heck, even HR is incompetent on a multitude of levels). Retaining the incompetent only hurts the all-important bottom-line and in time, all your best talent will leave for greener pastures.
The bell curve that is used to rate employees is very controversial as well, where most employees will fall under average 3/5, and thus are not deserving of abovementioned dodgy promotions. As HR does not reveal the black box algorithm that is employed to calculate bonuses, we can safely assume that the difference in bonus between a star performer and an “average” is an upsized Maccers meal. No biggie.
Deluded Top Management Hogwash
HR recently celebrated a year with 20+% attrition rate. A quarter of your force leaving your company is NOT something to call home about. “Another huge win” as they may call it, is the company’s confounded definition of achieving work life balance. 16hour days are not uncommon, especially at the bottom. I’ve heard my fair share of the 7pm MB tradition of “Can I see it first thing tomorrow morning?” HR should take a look at the office at 1030pm and see how many seats are still occupied + those working at home after hours. I have no idea what work life balance they are celebrating.
Timesheets are dysfunctional in itself, where we are encouraged “to clock accurately to make the case for new hires”, but when we red the job, we are questioned on over servicing and have to re-clock the hours to make the job green on paper. How very mysterious.

Also, top management tries to indoctrinate how lucky we are to have a swanky new office, bread, fruits and drinks on Fridays. It baffles me how they can selectively overlook the employees’ needs for basic working hours of 8.5hours and equitable monetary compensation in lieu of these peripherals. And no, promulgating “passion for our work” and how “we have done a great job” will not in any way at all replace proper, equitable salary increases and bonuses.
The hiring freeze continues, where current employees continue to bear the work of those who have left but were not replaced. If one can do the work of five, why not? It makes for perfect P&L sense. Now what employee morale?Show More","Stop pretending like you care about the employees welfare and career progression. Either you care or you don't.

- Good exit opportunities (Many chances to join top and well-paying organizations after slogging it out here for a while)","BAD LEADERSHIP

- Senior Management do not function as leaders, but accountants who only regard the short-term P&L as crucial, but not the long-term sustainable growth. This is clearly demonstrated when they had no qualms in freezing increments and promotions despite deserving staff having met / exceeded their objectives, and the SG office having registered a really positive double-digit growth YOY. This …  harsh measure is implemented to (in the own words by the management) 'protect the P&L'. Bonuses being slashed in other organizations are common occurrences during bad years, but I've rarely heard of companies promoting people, increasing their responsibilities but not giving them any increments.

- Senior Management ranks are generally filled up by 2nd grade professionals (their more capable counterparts in the research industry have gone on better organizations much earlier in their careers). If you do not believe me, go Google the public profiles of the senior management in MB. Check out their educational backgrounds, study majors and work experiences. You will find a severe lack in mentions of experiences within top Fortune 500 corporations or decent consultancy firms, or having studied at global top 100 universities.

- At the Account Director level, it isn't any better. Many directors became directors by virtue of their eloquence, aggression (as needed in a sales role) and sheer vast amount of experience in this industry. They are only concerned about hitting the sales targets (partly because the company exerts lots of pressure on them). Leading, inspiring and taking care of the staff working under them is probably not a key priority for them.

HIGH TURNOVER

- Talent drain is a serious issue. Annual turnover rate even reached over 30% in one particular year not too long ago. Capable, hardworking managers and senior executives move on to better paying industries and roles, leaving a gap which are filled in by many 2nd grade expats who are neither competent, hardworking nor good people managers. Some of the expats from Europe are quite good at what they do, but not many of the expats from 'somewhere in the South Pacific'.

- Together with the recent freezing of increments as mentioned above, a hiring freeze was also implemented. Thus, people who have since left the company were not replaced, leaving the shrinking existing pool of people on take on even more responsibilities. The freeze certainly won't help with the work-life balance.

MONETARY COMPENSATION

- Poor monetary compensation. The paygrade that is often lauded by the HR as being 'fair' is based on comparisons with other market research agencies, which generally do not pay that well either. Thus, comparing the salaries between MB, Nielsen, Ipsos, TNS etc. is akin to comparing a rotten apple to another rotten apple.

Did I mention that they withheld the increments which are usually accompanied with promotions?

WORKING HOURS / CULTURE

- Months on end of leaving the office no earlier than 9pm are not uncommon occurrences. You will find a large pool of mainly executives and some hardworking managers/directors regularly staying back late to finish the huge pile of work.

- Inequitable distribution of workload between teams and across ranks. There are several 'deadweight' managers and directors who push huge bulks of their responsibilities to the junior executives (RA, RE and SRE)

- There is a culture of 'go get it done, but I don't care how you manage to do it' adopted by many directors. They are aware that certain demands will dictate that you burn the weekend to complete the task, but won't lessen the demands nonetheless.Show More","We are in the people business and distill insights from consumer data to advise clients on brand/advertising tactics etc. Try listening to the people on the ground and hear their concerns, and then implement some changes to retain your people."

My review is based on my experience in the Research Management Department.

1) THE HOURS. They fully exploit the fact that you are salaried and 'agreed to opt out of the working hours regulation act' to milk you for every hours worth of UNPAID overtime going. As they say to you, they 'expect' you to do at least 25% unpaid …  overtime. That is a mere dip in the ocean. The salary you earn does not at all cover the hours you are bullied into.
I had to do around 10 hours overtime per week, equaling around 40 hours a month and thus, around a week per month, for free... No lunch break, and if a manager or associate director ever thinks you're about to go home, they will ensure to give you their work (but still take the credit). Hierarchy try to brainwash younger staff/first jobbers that this is simply how it is in the working world..it's really not.

2)THE MANAGEMENT. Pretty inept in everyway going. Managers+ like to speak down to everyone, 'the (pay) skale' below them. They will make frequent mistakes on a project and proceed to blame everyone but themselves, stating they should only be overseeing something, not getting involved in any of the graft. The people that usually kop the blame, are recent joiners and graduates. However, it has to be said, very occasionally, a Research Manager may take the honorable option and blame someone on holiday or at the doctors..
The managers here tend to be quite young, ego through the roof, due to having such a title. The reason why the managers/'associate' directors at Millward Brown are so young, leads nicely into my next point..

3)TURNOVER OF STAFF. Turnover is pretty shocking, you will struggle to encounter anyone who has stayed more than 2 years - it's a 'don't bother getting to know anyone' company. There is a constant negative air about the place. All of the grads I ever met, turned up at Millward Brown positive and excited to kickstart a career there. After about 2 months the Grads were already stating that they wanted to leave as soon as they'd got a year to put on their CV and that they had been lied to about what the job entailed (see point 4).. not the type of ethos that should be around new recruits....

The only people you will meet that have been at MB for more than 5 minutes are managers and above, as they're the only people that have soured enough to be able to carry on at such a place.
On a separate note - I'd like to echo views of another review - Nobody knows what anybody does at Millward Brown Warwick! It's packed with glum looking people with meaningless job titles; ie 'Data Processing Analyst' means that you receive data from MB India and put the data into a spreadsheet in the right fields..

4) THE ROLE itself. I can only comment on the position of 'Research Executive' but I would like to say that the role was boring, malignant, uninspiring, unskilled and I could have trained my Labrador to do the job. All you do is 1) Email other departments 2) Check that questionnaires work properly on a computer 3) Check that there is some form of data on a spreadsheet, any number, anything. 4) Fill out forms. I can't put into words how much they lie to you at the interview - I was told I would be involved in making conclusions and evaluations from the data. I was told I would be involved in conducting research reports and using some form of brain matter. None of that whatsoever. There is no skill to the role. You will not learn anything.Show More","Try doing excessive unpaid overtime yourself, instead of delegating everything and sprinting to the door at 5pm prompt.

Social events. We had an annual talent competition, which was popular and well-organised. This has now been cancelled.

Flexible hours. Start between 8:30 and 9:30, the leave between 17:00 and 18:00 as appropriate. i.e. If you arrive at 9:00, you would go at 17:30. In general, this can be expanded further for parents.

On-site canteen. Variety of meals, plenty of seating, themed …  days, Christmas menu, hot drinks selection.

Meaningless business-speak is thankfully quite rare.Show More","I've had to deal with senior-level employees that wanted to knowingly send out wrong numbers to clients. On one occasion this was because we had sent out so much wrong data to a client, that the senior member of the team now wanted to replicate wrong data as an attempt to cover up previous mistakes. I have refused all these requests and always informed the management.

Other department members have been taken …  away and told they have not been working enough overtime.

Heavy crack-down on people arriving late. Several people have got in trouble for being one minute late. One employee was spoken to by HR, despite being less than five minutes late.

Open plan office, usually with about a hundred people per room. Not an ideal environment for people that can get stressed or need peace.

Several years have had no salary reviews company-wide. That includes this year (2014).

The office will be moving.

Constant group of employees smoking at the front of the building. Not a great image for clients.

Any notable decision has to go through many people, which massively slows down the decision making process. Decisions are frequently made by people that are completely detached from the consequences and have minimal knowledge of the situation.

Use of technology feels a long way behind our competitors.

Progression can be based on tiny things. If I massively improve the work that I do for 95% of my job, this will have no effect. I need to improve the 5% part. The company is offering me no help to improve that part.

Newsletters have to go through multiple members of management for censorship.

High staff turnover in project management and the client-facing department. Consequently there's always a large amount of inexperienced people and it can be difficult to form a strong team. Having projects run by new people that lack confidence and experience often leads to problems.

Company satisfaction survey results are awful and have decreased again. Despite this, the management keep entering our company into The Times' ""Best Companies to work for"" competition. Unsurprisingly, we've never made it into the top 100.

Increasingly, the data processing work is being off-shored, which means lower quality and presumably will lead to redundancies here.

Company targets are constantly being missed. By a long way.

There was a large company restructure, which many people disliked. This led to a lot of people leaving.

Job titles in some departments change frequently. Job titles in other departments are words that have no meaning. For example, ""Data Processing Specialists"" do not need to specialise in anything.

In Data Processing the staff turnover is extremely minimal. Consequently the highest members of staff tend to be highest due to length of service and not skill. This means the more advanced tasks are often given to people with mid-level jobs, rather than higher-level jobs.

We are constantly losing clients. The amount of new work coming in is significantly less than the amount we have lost.Show More",NA

Anyone relatively new is already planning their escape or is simply too busy and burnt out to look for another job (only reason I'm still here).

People are nice, hours are decent, and work is relatively predictable. You gain the opportunity to work with some of the world's most recognized companies to help them gain insights on and …  strengthen their brands. (Most of your exposure will be to industries that spend a lot of money on marketing - like consumer products, food & beverage, apparel, healthcare / pharma, financial services, and other consumer facing brands).

Some of the work can be fascinating - like understanding consumers, their relationship to brands, why they make certain purchasing decisions, what's most important to them, customer trends, digital marketing, etc. There is a big focus on customer engagement & relationship building.

MB has fairly well thought out methodologies and frameworks for building strong brands, customer relationships, making money from marketing investments, and applying all this to the exploding number of marketing avenues that are now out there (and becoming more complex and varied by the day - especially digital). MB's global ""thought leaders"" provide interesting ideas that are then integrated into some of MB's services.

There are some perks - like occasional free tickets to conferences, tickets to sports games, beer on Fridays (in the NYC office at least), some brief trainings, a brightly painted office, relaxed dress code, opportunities to volunteer, managers that tend to be laidback, etc. It is also great to be part of a global network of MB agencies (there are many of them - called ""specialist practices"") and WPP Group - one of the largest marketing media communications conglomerates in the world - with its plethora of sister agencies.Show More","For all of its frameworks and research methodologies, MB can sometimes feel like it lacks passion and leadership. There are times when employees are given cookie cutter molds of how to do client work, some pre-made cookie dough, and then asked to just fill in the molds for each client on the list.

This does not leave much room for creativity, original thinking on client challenges, room to re-imagine how to …  better achieve client goals. The company is a nice place if you want relatively stable work and stable hours with nice colleagues, and don't want to rock the boat too much. If you like more creative leeway to do your job, a chance to infuse your passion into your work, it can feel bureaucratic at times - especially some of the processes for conducting market research.

People tend to settle into their work and get used to the ""same 'ol same 'ol"". This can sometimes feel like a lack of passion - the team just going through the motions. Leadership when I was there was not particularly strong. They were nice and friendly, but not particularly courageous or looking to take risks in order to build a strong empowered culture.

As a result many managers who got ahead figured out ways to game the system and politically become the favorites of important decision makers. It wasn't necessarily a love of their job, service & results to clients, skill set, or passion for work that got them ahead. This shows in how entry level people and teams are managed - without that passion or risk taking.

There was a lot of turbulence when I was there during the recession. They had to lay people off and did this in a way that was very non-transparent - catching people off guard, and without the courage to get their hands in the messy difficult work of explaining to people what was happening. Also some of the divisions are less successful than others, and this can cause issues and in-fighting.

The salary is not great, and many employees perpetually grumbled about it. But it seems to me if you want a higher salary you would want to choose somewhere else where you are less of a line worker and more engaged in difficult strategic thinking, ideas, and implementation.Show More","Consider being more transparent with the major decisions you are making - whether it be refining some of MB's services, decisions with specialist practices, and especially management hiring & firing, etc. The layoffs that occurred recently were handled terribly and without much courage or leadership.

This will engage your people in being more passionate about where they work - so we feel less like line …  workers and more like branding and marketing frontiers blazing a path of knowledge and insight that has tangible value to our clients.Show More"

2. Excellent and young talent pool; majority of the junior staff is hired straight out of ivy league schools, and they are enthusiastic and passionate. Most of the team members have a “can do” attitude that holds even when the hours get …  long and the work gets tough.

3. The work and clients are very interesting and wide-ranging, which means exposure to lots of different industries. With no more than 50 people in the firm, there are abundant opportunities to have direct contact with these clients fairly soon after starting the job.Show More","1. Complete lack of structure. The hierarchy in the office is unclear. Junior consultants consistently overstep Associate Directors, and communicate directly with the VPs, which leaves project leadership out of the loop. The junior staff feels comfortable enough sending “joke” email chain that include VPs, which should be an indicator that there is no respect/recognition of authority. I understand that this firm …  prides themselves on being “entrepreneurial” but employees need to know where they stand in the hierarchy, and clear lines of authority need to be established. The lack of structure and proper incentives leads to inefficiencies, and strips project leadership of the authority that is needed to complete work efficiently and effectively.

2. Lack of professionalism in the office. This is dictated by the senior leadership, who are prone to emotional outbursts, and to criticizing employees in full view of the office; this sets the tone for the junior staff. As a result, the junior staff members are often disrespectful to their peers and to their project leadership. Internal meetings always begin late or are cancelled last minute without prior notice and/or justification.

3. No vehicle for feedback, either direct or anonymous. When employees raise points for discussion in executive team meetings, they are berated by senior leadership. This obviously deters most people from providing the honest feedback that is needed to help the team grow. There is a “my way or the highway” mentality amongst the senior leadership and other team members who have been at the firm the longest

4. Lack of work/life balance. I understand that this particular line of work often involves long hours. However, the leadership does NOT look out for the junior team members – particularly analysts – by managing timelines and workstreams more effectively so that work is completed at reasonable hours. The culture does not reward efficiency that gets you out of the office at a reasonable hour. Most of the office stays past 10 pm, and often until 1-3 am the following day, while still being expected to come in at 9 am the following day. All-nighters are common, and junior staff members are afraid to complain.

5. The performance review system is subjective and lacks transparency. VPs deliver the performance evaluations for everyone in the office to include junior analysts which whom they have little contact. Although project leadership - who work directly with the junior personnel - is asked for input, it would make MUCH more sense for the project manager to deliver the review. This would incentivize the junior staff to actually work for their direct/project manager as well as the senior management. Employees are often blindsided by extremely negative feedback, that has little factual basis. For example, being told that your work is great, but you are not a “star” is neither constructive nor actionable.

6. Lack of formal training programs. On the job training works, but developing/implenting a 1-2 week training program for incoming analysts (and a shorter variation for incoming senior management) would pay huge dividends.Show More","The bottom line: this firm has a lot of potential, but it is not a place to work if you want structure, a fair/transparent evaluation process or any sort of work/life balance. Despite preaching growth, leadership is completely resistant to change, and refuses to address serious problems with issues such as work/life balance. This firm must take a serious look at its procedures and processes if it hopes to retain …  talent and continue to grow in the years to come.Show More"

If you were looking for an entry-level job, MB is a great place to learn the market research business.","The new service delivery model for the Client Services department does not work.

Taken from the perspective of 10,000 feet up, the new model make sense as it cuts down on redundant work, empowers employees to act more like consultants and boosts job profitability.

From the perspective of the employee, the new model makes for a very challenging work life. With no foundation level support on accounts …  mid-level managers must spend a lot of time handling routine tasks or responding to basic client requests (such as data-pulling, charting, etc...). With a lot of time spent responding to and handling what use to be foundation level tasks there is much less time to focus on higher level, and more time intensive, tasks such as generating insights for clients or becoming experts in their businesses.

The new model spreads mid-level managers too thin, and as a result long-time clients have voiced frustration with the reduced level of consultancy they are receiving from MB and employees are constantly under a great deal of stress.

Work weeks are consistently in the neighborhood of 50+ hours and at times exceed 60 hours. With the new model, there are no account teams so when a mid-level employee goes on vacation or leaves the company it often makes for a very difficult situation. On top of what is frequently a very heavy workload, everyone in the office has to pick up the slack for the person that is out, which can leave employees frustrated. At times, vacations have been cancelled or reduced due to inadequate staffing resources.

The new model took what was once a rewarding and enjoyable career as a brand consultant, and turned it into a white collar assembly line where the pace keeps getting faster and faster.Show More","Scrap the Service Delivery Model. If that is not possible, reduce the number of accounts an employee is responsible for so that they can properly service them. Take the concerns of employees seriously, especially the mid-level employees, as they are uniquely positioned to have have their fingers on the pulse of the business.

Lastly, communicate change more effectively and show employees that you are working …  to make life better for them. A lack of genuine concern from the upper management team translates into ""nobody cares about you, work harder and be quiet.""Show More"

The truth is, it's basically a white-collar sweatshop. Forget about having a work-life balance; at MB you will find yourself burning the candle at both ends during the week, and often coming into the office on the weekends as well, just to …  meet deadlines. MB simply doesn't allot enough resources to service accounts so everyone just ends up working late all the time. It doesn't get any better when you're a manager or a director, either; they often work late, too, whether it's in the office with you or at home after they've put their kids to sleep. There has to be something fundamentally wrong with a business model when people work really really hard and still cannot get paid salaries that are commensurate to their efforts. I think this is because MB is, as one other reviewer pointed out, a ""dinosaur"" in the industry; it simply can't afford to command a premium price for its services because it's facing stiff competition from other research agencies.

And then there are the horrible managers. MB has a tendency to promote people because they threaten to leave, or because they've been there for a while. This leads to having a bunch of people in upper management who basically don't know the first thing about leading people. Just because someone is a good researcher doesn't mean he'll make a good manager. There is a lot of this ""just get it done, I don't care how"" mentality. The managers know the workload is insane. For example, a manager may be aware that his exec will have to pull an all-nighter for a project that came in at the last minute. But in the back of his mind, he'll console himself with this thought: ""Well, I paid my dues; now it's their turn!""

Company prides itself on being a leader in the industry, the cream of the crop, yet they do not pay their employees accordingly. This is a huge disconnect with the image the senior management portrays. A salary audit was done a few years back and they claim we are paid a competitive salary, yet we never saw any of the information from this audit. Company has …  quietly ditched cost of living increases, so future compensation won't be getting any better.

Company is currently in the midst of a drastic change to it's structure, which has gone poorly at best. The restructuring resulted in significant layoffs and resignations, to the point where I question who will be the next group of leaders in this company. Leadership seems to be oblivious to the fact that this upheaval has caused most employees to begin looking elsewhere. Even after a number of people left for other jobs, there seemed to be little concern that others will follow. Let me tell you, there will be others, myself included.

Much of the problems with the new structure is the senior managements' refusal to listen to concerns from the workers who were closest to the change. They seem more interested pushing their agenda (and reaping their HUGE bonuses) rather than actually listening to the people affected most by this change. They are just now starting to listen and make changes, but it may be too late given we have lost so many good employees already.

The company continues to cut costs by out sourcing, reducing staff, removing raises, etc and yet the workers see no benefit from these actions, other than more work, slower processes, more mistakes, and unhappier clients. The only people who seem to benefit is the senior managers, as they continue to receive promotions and huge bonuses, while the rest of us get nothing.

The Senior leaders of the office are at best very weak at leading an office. So many 'secret' meetings behind closed doors,and they are not sincere or honest with the staff. Positive changes promised but never implemented. Senior management cannot forecast or provide the 'selling' tools needed to build business which has lead to several …  layoffs.

Senior management tends to value those who can BS the best, can be most controlled and are willing to be ""yes"" people.

Recently, several senior people in the company have been brought in from outside the company . They are put in place above others that have been with MB for many years .These tenured people know more about research than most of these outside people. Seniority at MB actually works as a disadvantage and those tenured people are in a sense 'demoted' to report into others that really don't know the business.

Too many business models implemented in the last 3 years (along with 3 lay offs).
The latest business model was based on many of the same ideas as the last model. This created a wider separation in roles, taking the research and removing it from the client engagement.
This model is based on a recommendation from a 3rd party consulting company brought in to tell them what is wrong with the way we are working rather than listening to the people working in the organization.

Employees (including me) have been put into roles that many are not comfortable or experienced performing.

People are forced into one role or the other, and expected to fit that role completely. We have been expected to stop thinking about the actual research process and just focus on one facet. Factory mentality has been implemented, with a long list of 'this is what you do' and 'this is what you don't do' - forcing an 'it's not my job' mentality to the point that we will be written up if we do something not in our 'list' of responsibilities. This type of disconnect between roles has lead to miscommunication, no one is really looking out for the whole business, inefficiencies, and errors being overlooked and I see bad things happening already.

We lost many loyal, talented people that really cared about the company, their staff and their clients in this last round of layoffs.

Morale has hit an all time low, job security is non-existent, and many of the staff in the office are currently looking to leave Millward Brown (myself included). People are leaving in droves, recently about 20 people were laid off from this office and several others resigned.

- Global footprint, and heritage of information resources.
- Chance to learn about brands and industries, if you're individually motivated.
- Pleasant, hard working junior staff. There's some camaraderie there.","Poor Senior Leadership
-- Over the last several years, a new breed of senior leadership has been brought in. They aren’t any good at brand consulting or research, rather their skills are in the ""bla bla"". But they don't seem to know how, or maybe just aren't willing to solve serious organizational problems.
-- There's little commitment or accountability for anything besides financial data. They announce annual …  ambitions, broadly fail to deliver on them, then re-frame the same issues next year. Sometimes it's truly painful being in senior management meetings -- witnessing the superficial exchanges, the lack of commitment, the 0-impact outcomes.
-- Office-wide communications are inconsistent, distorted, and patronizing. And they have a tone of enthusiasm that's just not genuine.
-- Some senior people are willing to cross ethical lines if it suits them. Generally involving lying or misrepresentation in order to protect themselves, at the expense of someone junior to them.

Deficiency of Research-Intelligence
-- There is a history of granting promotions for time-in-role, rather than merit. And generally there's inadequate training & mentoring. A few excellent training modules have been imported, however account leaders are not required to get trained or adapt their practices. So, despite the clear advantages of new approaches and junior staff eager to try them out, sub-standard approaches widely persist.
-- Unfortunately, the day-to-day work-culture bears little resemblance to the ""Brand Ideal"" published in colorful booklets. Emphasis is on process work, not intelligent research design, analysis, and consultation. Many accounts have serious data obesity issues and / or have spiraled into dysfunction from neglect. There’s lots of back-room firefighting and window dressing. If you’re any good, you'll be assigned to the worst accounts, and can enjoy long hours fixing problems and bringing the research into the 21st century.

Staffing Dysfunction
-- The % of Client Service time focused on research design, analysis, and consultancy has diminished in recent years. This is a result of very poor implementation of a sensible staffing change. Essentially, there were many people who weren't very confident / adept with client consulting, analysis, and presentation. But they tended to be very familiar with Millward Brown's internal processes -- overseeing quality controls, filling / circulating forms and organizing procedural efficiencies with support departments. Management decided, rightly, that such people should focus on that type of work exclusively. But management took the path of least resistance, announcing that everyone could choose the area they preferred to continue with, and that because both functions are integral to the process, salary scales would be equal. Well, more than half of ""client service"" chose to abdicate the stress & responsibility for client consultancy, analysis, and presentation.
         -- It would have turned out better if management had: thought about the amount of skill set A vs B actually
            required to service an account effectively, re-assessed the market value of each function, and then
            opened a specific # of positions with appropriate salary scales that people could apply to. That way
            there's not an exodus from client-facing roles, you appropriately compensate staff for differentiated roles,
            and you have some budget to hire the people you need to do the client-facing, analysis-oriented work.
-- The resource managers have factory-line mentality, and assign staff to accounts with superficial, if any, consideration of casting or career development. Sometimes they either don't know what they're assigning, or maybe it's bait & switch. They'll tell you you're getting 1 tracking study, so you agree -- then you find out it's actually 1 account, with tracking in 6 markets and 3 categories. And they definitely expect you to work 50+ hours / week. I've had a client tell my manager that the quantity of work assigned -- on that one account -- was absurd!
-- Slapdash appraisal and promotion process, that differs every time. Also, feedback is not necessarily a two-way street. In the past 4 years I was not asked to rate my managers or group head even once. There are few incentives for ""star"" performance, and promotions are too slow coming. Some people have worked out promotions only by threatening to leave.

Low Morale, High Turnover
-- Morale has been on a downward slide for years, and I don't expect any serious action to address it.

- Does a couple of things (e.g., advertising & communications evaluation) very well. However, this can also be a ""con"" (see below).

- Strong commitment to capturing and oprganizing learning . . . and using this knowledge bank to develop points-of-view grounded in observation rather than theory or conjecture.

- Senior client service …  personnel are expected to bring in revenue, but it is not as cut-throat and $-centric as other research agencies; ""non-salesy"" types can do well in middle-to-upper client service roles (though not if you are a total introvert).

- It is a nice-sized company . . . big enough to have resources and an international presence . .but small enough that you can make a difference.

- Junior-level personnel will have opportunity for client interaction; many account leaders are good about providing that exposure.Show More","- If you are looking to be a seasoned and well-rounded marketing research expert, I would NOT recommend MB as a long-term stop on the career journey for two reasons:

FIRST, almost the only thing MB does is research in the area of advertising and brand equity. You will likely NOT have much if any opportunity to be exposed to the following types of marketing research: customer satisfaction, concept testing, …  pricing, corporate reputation, segmentation, attitude & usage, conjoint/ discrete choice, market mix modeling, forecasting, packaging, etc, etc.

SECOND, most MB projects use ""off the shelf"" methodologies with rather rigid protocols . . .so you don't get too much experience with designing a customized methodology to handle a unique marketing research issue.

For these reasons, MB employees who came to the company right out of school and are, say, five years into their careers seem to have far less opportunity outside the company than early-mid career employees of other research agencies that cast a broader net.

Please note I do not criticize MB for being focused, but just be aware that it is not a good place to build a large marketing research toolbox. But you will get a lot of really good learning if you spend 2-4 years at MB, preferably as a mid-career rather than early career landing spot.

Other cons:

- It seems the best and brightest aren't the ones who necessarily get the promotions. This has resulted in the company losing some very good people over the years.

- Some senior people work their tails off and model a strong work ethic; others work 9-4 with 2 hours for lunch, have their subordinates do all their work, and seem to get all the credit, with top management oblivious to it all.

- MB does not seem to fully leverage the offerings of other WPP companies; not as much cross-pollination of talent across WPP companies as could be possible.Show More","MB actually runs a pretty good ship. Might just want to be a little more transparent on what defines each level of the career hierarchy and on what is required to move up the ladder . . . there seems to be a lot of inconsistency in doling out promotions, with favoritism sometimes trumping competence and ability. Also, give employees more opportunity to do rotations with other WPP companies to more fully understand …  the marketing and media landscape.Show More"

The 'yes-man' type managers won't report the issues properly to their superiors, if they do it at all, so upper management is not aware of the growing difficulties in the department.

- Obsolete software coupled with …  understaffed, underfunded IT dept. means improvements are excruciatingly slow. The software is not user-friendly, it is non-customisable and rigid so does not support the level of detail, the volume of data and the changing nature of the market. If you ask for anything, the standard response is 'there's no budget'.

- Basic targets have not been reviewed for years despite the changes in the market, meaning they have become increasingly harder to hit in the normal working hours, so employees get anxiety, have no breaks during the day, work through lunch or stay working later. If you happen to hit target early, they'll tell you to keep working anyway, so you can't even take that short amount of time to go network and bond with your colleagues.

- You do not receive a yearly raise that covers inflation and rising living costs in London, so unless you get promoted, you have in fact less disposable income every year. The bonus incentive is also really, really low, so people often don't bother with going the extra mile and putting the work in. This is an entry-level position after all, so something better will come along soon = high staff turnover. To add insult to injury, the quarterly presentations often point out how high the company's profits are and how they are expected to grow, which sits really badly with people earning the lowest wages, who know this won't benefit them at all.

- Performance reviews are a waste of time. There is no added incentive to the given goals for the year, and if you do succeed, this does not lead to a raise or a recommendation/fast-track to another job in the company. Nobody will know if you did really well apart from your line manager.

- Despite all major issues affecting the dept. in terms of software and targets, managers expect an unrealistic level of work quality that cannot be provided through the available means. Changes come in and go constantly and rapidly, adding to the anxiety and stress, and people have to memorise all sorts of details and rules that could be facilitated through better technology. Management will call you out and supervise you about the smallest things, but do nothing about the big picture. Employees are micro-managed, and every decision needs to be checked with a manager or other departments before proceeding, depriving employees from developing a sense of accountability, autonomy and responsibility.

- There is a general atmosphere that does not empower employees to speak out about issues they're facing in a constructive, positive and transparent manner. They fear (justifiably or not) negative consequences and backlash, and nobody wants to risk their career prospects for having complained too much.

If you’re a ambitious and motivated millennial, save yourself the time and accept an offer elsewhere—with a company that invests in the long term success of employees. It all became clear to me why managers can be unfriendly with their direct reports, it’s because management is a skill and a career path in itself.

- Access to M&Ms in the lobby, which can be used sparingly to “address the occasional sweet tooth”
- Job …  itself was good - if you enjoyed writing book reports as a kid, this is the opportunity to basically do that full time as an adult under the guise of “research”.

The company does offer some real benefits, including strong work-life balance such as the ability to work from home.Show More","For starters, the open concept office space breeds germs and people are constantly sick through winter, which isn’t a deal breaker but it does get annoying.

However, the biggest con is that despite having regular reviews, Mintel does not give employees annual pay raises - nothing, not even cost of living. Management generally thinks the strong work-life balance will make up for this, but very high turnover …  suggests it's not working. To get a salary increase, one must make a lateral move, receive a promotion, or work on the food team.

Despite some departments supposedly having established career paths, the requirements for moving up the career path are murky at best. Managers were actually told that they couldn't share the promotion requirements with employees, making it hard to know what skills you need to work on in order to actually get promoted. Promotions are also very budget-driven and not performance-based. In other words, they’ll tell you that if you do XYZ you’ll get a promotion, but the reality is you might have to wait a full year until the next fiscal budget in order to get that promotion. Also, promotions are basically title changes, no change in responsibilities, so you aren’t actually boosting your resume. Essentially, these career paths were created to give the illusion of career growth, even though growth doesn't actually exist.

Additionally, because of high turnover, managers are friendly with their direct reports and avoid confrontation, but this friendliness means that they rarely provide the constructive criticism that people need to improve their performance. As a result, people can be clueless as to whether they are a high performer or if they’re struggling.

The Mintel culture is also OK for some, but not for everyone. There's a set of Mintel lifers who thrive at being big fish in a small pond, and seem to be constantly patting each other on the back. If you manage to slip into this “in-crowd” you’ll be taken care of at the company. If not, working there can be awful.Show More","Mintel isn’t the only company these days that has strong work-life balance, especially in the market research industry where most work can be done remotely. Reward people with money if you want them to stay, or come up with real career paths so that they can actually develop their skillset, as opposed to just getting title changes."

MMS managers think that the longer you spent at your desk …  = better quality work. One of the reason those who worked in MMS don't interact that much with other team in Mintel, and are always at their desk, because we're being watched constantly.

Intense favoritism within the team, and no room for career progression - they would rather promote someone because they work here longer than someone, rather than looking at individual performances. High staff turnover, with most of the ex-colleagues quit to become unemployed...

This is a company that rewards mediocrity and staying within prescribed boundaries, while trying to appear innovative and cutting-edge. Management and HR encourage a negative on-edge culture, where employees know that everyone is dispensable. This creates an impression that, as an employee, you are not worth listening to and do not have any value. Indeed, there are no attempts to solicit …  feedback from those lower down the company chain.

Agile working and no assigned desks means people try to come in earlier and earlier in the morning to get the desks they want, which is (of course) better for the business, but illustrates the basic lack of respect for the worker-bees. What's more, HR has decided that it would be a great idea to rotate groups of desks/shuffle groups of people between different floors and the two existing offices every 3 months, creating an atmosphere of permanent uncertainty, as if to keep people on their toes.

The company is very tight-fisted with certain groups of employees (analysts), yet showers others with perks (sales). Certain people travel internationally all the time - you hardly see them in the office. For the rest of the company, there is no budget even for a trade magazine subscription. This makes for an atmosphere of unfairness and disgruntlement. Though maybe constant cake may make people forget about the otherwise depressing environment.

The open plan office/parties with booze are geared towards the youngest employees, but that won't make them forget about the absence of a good pension scheme or any other benefits for that matter. Plenty of others have also mentioned no/very stingy pay rises. No career progression (the newly created hierarchy of research positions is a joke, to say the least).

The business model of hiring graduates on low salaries to do research for 1-2 years until they leave for greener pastures has worked so far (though I do wonder how much money is being wasted on all the hiring and training), but Mintel should seriously consider whether or not this is a sustainable model if they want to be a leading market research company.

At the moment, and much like many of the other MR agencies in Central London, Mintel is a company that's good for a recent grad for 1-2 years tops, not a long-term career building opportunity.Show More","Show employees that you value them, and, no, free booze and cake is not enough, when people can't afford to live in London on the salaries you pay."

A lot of this is because the company is run by people who have been there for many years. Upper management consists completely of people who have worked themselves up through the company.

Good work-life balance, in theory, but in reality it entirely …  depends who your boss is and what their attitude to working late and early and weekends is.Show More","Everyone has said it, and I will throw my hat into the ring as well: the salary is atrocious. I got a 30% higher salary for a very similar role when I moved, which shows how drastically I was being underpaid. Aside from that, trying to get a salary raise if you are not one of management's favourites is nigh on impossible. After a year and a half of working there, I was told there was no room in the budget for …  raises, despite knowing that others in my team had been given raises.

Which leads me on to another big problem: career progression: given that there is no actual system in place, it is entirely up to individual bosses to push for development of the team. Not only was I told there was no room in the budget for a raise, having achieved all my targets, but there was no suggestion of how to work towards a raise. Never mind actual career progression, which is impossible unless you have been at Mintel at least 5 years, or have someone in management pushing for you to be developed.

As I mentioned above, they have issues with fairness, even within small teams. Intense favouritism and politics within teams is the norm, and there is absolutely no mechanism for reporting this outside of the boss doing the favouritism.

The company places a lot of emphasis on 'fun' however company politics is rife, and the culture is more competitive and aggressive than 'fun'. A quirky office does not a fun place to work make.

The company rewards time in service more than quality of work.

Training is non-existent.

Put less emphasis on years served at the company and more on quality of work delivered.

You have GREAT policies surrounding work-life balance, but many team leaders are not forced to adhere to them, meaning that people in that team who would like to take advantage are alienated. Take WFH and Flexi working out of the hands of team leaders and make it into an individual choice.

Having been drafted into meeting to ASSURE employees that their product is …  selling well rather than speak the truth that the management do not want to spend any more on salary is a slap in the face!

I also assumed that management just want to spend less and earn more to increase their profit margin without any significant investment in employees. Lack of formal training would explain why the quality of reports are sub-standard, compare to competitors, where they goes into further details and much more critical and analysis of each market.

Treating employees to cheap food and drinks will only keep them satisfy for a temporary period, and not fix the biggest issue which is salary.

One of the only reason that most people enjoyed working there is the people, whom help each other to get by each day without mental break down due to amount of workloads being given.

GNPD is a good product. The company does things no other professional firms want to do like Nielson, GfK, Eurominitor. GNPD is basically Mintel paying absolutely rock-bottom minimum wage to field agents around the …  world to buy consumer goods.

Useful for marketing, corporate planning professionals. Great product (no sarcasm).Show More","I have to start with this one. The salary is rock-bottom. Not even enough to live on. As other reviewers say the turnover is incredibly high and the company relies on one-off employees. Most that produce research are on minimum-wage. The management has a wrong idea about cost-cutting. They are always trying to find stupid employees that can't get a job elsewhere and are willing to take minimum wage jobs. You would …  be lucky to take home £7 an hour (after taxes). Is 14k (yes pretax!) a good salary for someone who works in London? I felt sorry and ashamed every time I had to speak with employees from GNPD.

Employees have no loyalty to the company. Do what you preach to your clients.

Everything is done cheaply - employees are getting paid to do google search. One client actually told me that they can easily find the data we sell on the internet. Not even good for due diligence purposes. I thought the client had it right, but couldn't confirm it at all. What researchers call trade interview is cold-calling, nothing more. We have no capabilities to do field interview as Nielson or GfK do (we are too cheap to pay telephone interviewers!) and can't design questionnaires properly.

Employees are uneducated. This is industry-wide, but the HR look for cheap labour, hence stupid employees. I can't remember if there are any with a MBA. Well, I suppose Google-search doesn't need a degree from Cambridge. But that puts us in a difficult position - we are selling products to people who are smarter and happier than us. How is that possible?

Contradictory management. They say one thing such as internal promotion is prevalent, but most feel absolutely stuck on their roles. There are no vertical career progression, just horizontal career change (if you get what I mean?). If employees were 10 years younger, they would leave immediately. My colleagues left not to work for another company, but to become unemployed. Most work at Mintel. not because they want to, but because they have to so that we can feed ourselves.

There is no motivation for employees to do a good job. The company rather want you do less work than do more and get paid more. That reduces the take for owners of the company.

Strong and powerful HR that just stand in everyone's way.

I constantly questioned what Mintel actually did, what value we added to clients. Yes, we have pushy sales people (who can't do anything else including myself) and the PR team that do everything to polish the public image, but products we are selling are just not good enough. Clients don't use us the same way they use Gartner, Nielson or GfK. No company wants to cite us in their 10k, but think about it, why would strategic consultants, investment bankers or corporate planners who are much smarter than our researchers want to hear what our researchers think? They don't want to hear our analysis or read Mintel Oxgen reports (most of which are based on googling!). Management consider our researchers to be disposable and do not look after them at all! Mintel is a house of cards. We don't have much to sell.

Growth of the revenues comes from pushy salespeople who know how to sign up clients, at least for a short period of time. And finding even less sophisticated clients for next year.Show More","We can put up with your management style only if you pay us more. Please give researchers more incentive so that they produce better products. We, sales people, try to build relationship with buyers. If you are selling them second-class products, you will never see them again. It's that simple.

Otherwise, we just try to find ways to do less and less. The data is just coming off the internet (I can't explain …  why to clients - in fact, clients would be horrified to find that it is actually what is going on, most Mintel employees spend considerable time google-searching!!!). Sales people under the age of 40 just leave for a better company where you can get paid more. Once you turn 40, you are stuck there, a lifer at Mintel. What a life!

You must have had enough fun already. Fun office, fun people, fun work. Just grow up!

You have to spend money to make money.

Owners - Mintel's sales and profits come at the expense of employees, most of whom are minimum wage and consider working at Mintel to be not something to be proud of, but to bring home some cash so that we can feed ourselves.

Mintel needs to get creative and take more risks to really grow. Needs to acquire or adopt unique methodologies - rather than other published, syndicated data suppliers. That information …  exists elsewhere and doesn't make Mintel anymore of a ""need to have"".

Low salaries - High bonus structure (seen as a lack of trust in my eyes, and contributes to turnover within the less ""winning"" territories or books of business) as compared to all of Mintel's competitors or industry neighbors. If you lose a big account or miss your quota for a quarter, it's easy to check out mentally if it means you won't be getting a bonus you feel you deserve which doesn't benefit Mintel OR the employee long term - which is why other companies in the industry do it that way.

Politics/Favoritism (inevitable anywhere, but particularly impacts you if you work outside of the Chicago office)Show More","For the CPG side, the Account Management teams hierarchy is a chaotic mess. The same feedback from clients and updates of transactions have to happen 3 times, to update every step of the management tier which is severely inefficient and causes a burnout factor because those are office hours that could and should be spent working with the clients. The incentives and compensation plans need to be thought out again - …  since Mintel's tools are designed for the Conagras and P&G's of the world, it's demotivating to manage the accounts of the lesser tiered companies and ingredient suppliers (significantly smaller budgets) to the same growth rates and targets as those with the fortune 100 books. This is why the same handful of key account managers who got there first, will never leave (why should they), and also why those remaining AM roles (whose books are mostly made of everyone else's hand-me-downs) will always turnover until something is done to take care of this ""stacked deck"" effect. I was there for 6 years and saw and experienced many great things I'll always be thankful to Mintel for. But the hardest part is watching what could be a ""great"" company, repeatedly make mistakes and decisions that ensure it will continue to just be a ""good"" or ""solid"" company.Show More"

Furthermore, management seems to be playing favorites with …  individual contributors, rather than considering the quality of work in making decisions about who to retain and support.

Instead of hiring, keeping and promoting experienced workers, they are hiring fresh-outs who may have book knowledge about all the latest tools (e.g., keras), but who do not have the practical experience to apply them appropriately. The result is overly complicated and sub-optimal solutions to technical problems.

The consequences can clearly be seen in company results. The stock is down by more than half from its high, revenues are down, and there is talk about selling the business or taking it private.

You will have tech problems if not with your phone your surface pro. The CRM system is proprietary and extremely outdated! Average new rep will spend 2-6 hours a month with the help desk team. (this job can be extremely dangerous because you have to go inside the prospects home to close a deal! (A device collection process has to be excuted so the field reps bring the right equipment for the install) The way the pitch goes is you qualify clients 2 min elevator pitch, 5-10 min brochure pitch and if they are interested you conduct a panel interview takes 30 mins to an hr to complete (you can only recruit a home that matches specific demographics, age, race, family size, cable type) installs take about an hr per tv (so it can be a pretty timely event for the average home) You have to marry Nielsen to even have a chance of long term success in this position (an it will probably end up making you feel like you’re in an abusive relationship) This position has more turnover than street walkers! Run away! Very Quickly! (Not to mention a lousy commission plan, most reps don’t come close to making over 1k in commission per month)

It's touted to be amazing and makes the top lists for diversity, etc but in reality the culture is seriously lacking. I can't speak to the Chicago or NYC major hubs, but at the location I worked (which still had 100 or so employees) the culture was a joke. Hardly anyone came to events (only the same 5-10 or so people) because they didn't care to …  connect with colleagues outside of work, or they were too busy drowning in client projects.

Speaking of culture, let's take a minute to talk about the people leaders. Nielsen doesn't seem to do a great job in vetting low to mid level people leaders- while I had a few incredible managers, there were an equal number of ""managers"" who seriously did not know how to motivate, coach, and inspire employees. For one, it's hardly inspiring when your manager is working nonstop nights and weekends and can barely make time to meet with you.

Stop being so cheap with not backfilling open positions due to high turnover. Everyone is drowning in work and you're not helping the business turn itself around when you have client facing employees with poor morale. If they don't know already, HR needs to get a grip on how crummy the client service employee experience is these days. They seemed a little out of touch with reality when I was there.Show More"

It truly is a unique experience to see so many diverse and open minded people on one open space. No rat race between people (well, there are exceptions dying for 'visibility' that are well-known in the office), it's unlike anywhere else!
- People who get there during/after studies can learn tons!
- It used to be a good point to have on one's CV for 1.5-2 …  years, now not so sure
- Flexible working conditions (unless you get a terrible manager who is a pain - not uncommon)
- Truly, an ability to help the client turn their business around
- Team building activities, OneNielsen yearly event, Christmas Party, Nielsen Cares activities - all truly drive the company in the right directionShow More","- There is a number of offices in Warsaw. If you get the offer from Gdanski Office - run. Rotation there is infamously insane, and it got labeled (rightfully or not, no clue) as 'monkey job'. If you get an offer at Marynarska and enjoy working in Mordor - it's ok. Rotation there is also large but the jobs are quite less repetitive.
- There is a lot of students coming to work as professionals. Trainings are poor, …  their desired English language requirements deteriorated over recent years and what once was a fairly prestigious point on CV, starts to decline due to rotation, poor image of advertisements on tram stops and poor hires choices.
- Upper management is not transparent at all. Lower management who continuously receives poor reviews is shifted between groups/departments just because they have been in Nielsen for 10+ years. Lower management who receives praise is valued but has nearly no power at all.
- Management tends to derive from long lasting employees. Nothing wrong with that, but it lacks diversity. Nielsen's payroll doesn't account for external mngmt hires and the lack of external market experience is visible.
- Everyone knows that salaries are not great compared to the market and that N. compensates for it in many other ways (working conditions and people). Unfortunately people who do poor job don't get fired, but get promoted instead. This ends up with smart people juggling up to 4 to 7 projects earning the same as the ones who struggle with 1 or 2. In other words: it doesn't pay off to be ambitious and dive deep into data for the client - the pay is the same. Outperformers are rewarded with 'more ambitious projects' instead, which is simply ridiculous.
- Having seen no effort to keep the best people, while promoting those who are clueless lead me to leave the company. It wasn't about my personal in-house path, it was a worry about what the market's employee brand will look like soon.
- If you perform poorly, you go home early. If you outperform - you have troubles with work/life balanceShow More","1. Look for more external hires - 'Nielsen spirit' is not the end of the world.
2. Reward these who outperform. Go out from your glassdoor offices to the open space and talk to people everyday. You will quickly learn what is happening, as people are very open to express themselves.
3. If someone is good in technical aspects or even leading a technical team, it doesn't mean he or she will do a good manager. …  Look for interpersonal abilities and sensitivity.
4. Raise salaries and non-monetary benefits of outperformers - they really do more than 2-3 underperformers who are kept and receive the same salary!
5. Review the up & down management capabilities through an external audit.
6. Make sure that the Management-HR-Union triangle works together, not against each other!
7. When the CEO receives an 'incentive bonus' due to the stock decline and people see budget cuts - that doesn't bring a good picture. We all like Mitch with his slightly embarrassing anecdotes but really - the fish rots from the head down!
8. Press the HR to do exit interviews.Show More"

1) Access to data and breadth of opportunities. Being constantly challenged is really important to me in a role. The variety of data we work with and the wide client base means that the work can be quite varied, and it's easy to get involved in complex projects. There are obviously roles at Nielsen where you can do the same thing day in and day out …  for years, but there's also a lot of opportunity to grow if you look for it.

2) Culture. This is huge--probably the biggest reason I stay at Nielsen. Overall, the culture is very relaxed and meritocratic; people who are helpful, kind and engaged are the norm. The company truly recognizes and values from top-down everyone's achievements and individuality; I've never felt like a cog in the machine here, and I feel evaluated on merit, not my title or tenure. I really like the people I work with, too, not just on my immediate team, but more broadly. Nielsen hires a wide variety of people, but a common trait throughout (and encouraged through the culture) is being engaging and supportive.

Net net, I look forward to coming into work every day.Show More","Do I see myself leaving Nielsen someday? Possibly, yes, but it would be as a result of the company's health if they can't right the ship. For a self-titled ""technology company"", Nielsen leaves a lot to desired across multiple levels, which is frustrating because I want the company to do well. Developing measurement capabilities is incredibly difficult, and I don't want to understate that, but I wish we were pushing …  the gas pedal even harder on measurement capabilities. TV is dying; so, too, eventually will much of our revenue. If we can't get digital right, then Nielsen is going to become quickly irrelevant, and much of pro #1 is going to dissipate for me.

Also, a huge con is that Nielsen is already suffering financially, with no immediate end in sight. Layoffs, reorgs, the mad scramble to hit impossible revenue targets-it gets wearying. There are a lot of reasons why Nielsen isn't doing well, but one area that jumps out at me and frustrates me to no end is our technology (beyond measurement). Some of our products are, well, terrible. If you have to hire people to pull reports for clients because your products are so hard to use (there are -many- teams that do just this), it's arguable whether money might be better spent on improving the product? Relatedly, even in my department alone, there are a ton of things that could just be straight-out automated. Why should someone spend a week on highly canned decks that can be populated by a script in less than a minute? When Nielsen considers how to trim the fat, there's plenty of fat in inefficiency that never seems to be trimmed and should be. Throwing people at problems that should really be solved with technology is a recurring theme and one we need to be careful of.Show More",NA

IF you're interested in the M.R. position, it is common knowledge that they terminate the reps annually. First round is August, sept/oct is pushed for improved numbers and their bonus, then back to hell as they seek to have everyone fired before christmas. All the reviews calling it a ""turn-stile"" is true 100%. They lie during the interview that you can make 8-10K monthly bonus. Complete BS. I exceeded …  my performance and the best I could net after texas was $960 bonus. Salary/hourly is about 32K annual. They put reps on a ""schedule for success"" which is the path to rapid termination in three weeks. They even fraudulently filed FMLA on me and I wasn't sick! I wasted 1.5 year giving them time to fix things. yeah right. The board of directors are worthless and Dwight Barns (CEO destroying Nielsen) has a relationship with James Atwood of the Carlyle Group in NYC. Atwood becomes the Chairman of the Board jan. 2016. By Jan. 2017 the carlyle group completes it's first acquisition of a Nielsen subsidiary announced in their press release. Carlyle has also been funding Nielsen since 2006? Why? Dwight sits on the board for Monsanto for employee compensation and corporate responsibility. Seriously? I sent Dwight emails begging for field help including a cease and desist. Why did i get fired...??? I exceeded expectations on performance and did it in less than 40 hrs in a week, saved the company money and gave them excellent work. I got fired for being efficient. A friend got written up for being 7 minutes shy of her 40 hours. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WORK FOR Nielsen as long as Dwight is the CEO.

Someone needs to buy this company, like google, and restructure it from top to bottom. Since everyone has ""common knowledge"" of their abuse of power, why are they allowed to get away with this toxic behavior???? GOOGLE......!!!!! PLEASE BUY NIELSEN AND CLEAN HOUSE!!!

Oh yeah........the ratings aren't accurate like …  Netflix claimed months ago. Nielsen management lies and lies to clients, to employees to everyone associated with Nielsen. I don't know how they sleep at night. This company is BEYOND anything I've seen in my almost 30 years of corporate life. The first flag should've been their website talking non-stop about integrity. How come the code of conduct doesn't cover corruption in the U.S. but for global code of conduct, you can find the corruption segment? How come the board of directors are getting paid for ZERO over-sight??? If they were doing their jobs, why has attwood gotten away with an subsidiary acquisition in less than 12 months???

Nielsen has premeditated all kinds of violations per state and federally. Isn't Abuse of Power illegal?

Dwight is a total LOSER and has dragged all his NYC buds into the deep pockets of Nielsen. I suspect Dwight will get his golden parachute this year along with all his friends. The stock has dropped significantly from mid-50's last year to $35.79 as of this posting. Mark my words..........Nielsen is dying under Dwights leadership. Dwight doesn't care about his employees or his clients. Clients aren't happy among everyone else associated with nielsen. I should've quit within months of my hire date but I kept trustin management for changes. ""trust us, they said........""

If I can give it 0 star I would. To summarize, my time there was confusing and abused. These are a few of the major reasons I felt this way:
1. The entire time I was there, I felt my role was a complete redundancy and it made me question why they hired me in the first place. When I finally made a minor breakthrough in an assignment and was going to move onto a bigger …  piece, I received a linkedin recruiting message that used exact same words I used for my project. I was horrified receiving that because I felt unsafe. Not many people knew what I was working on at that point and for those that did I wouldn't have enough power to fight back. After that, I soon lost the tiny amount of support I received for the project - anyway it was already a conflict with another team from parent company.
2. I was interviewed for a senior role but upon receiving the offer it was the same role but minus ""senior"". My manager never talked to me about team visions and goals of my responsibilities. A month and 18 days after I was hired, our team had a first ever formal team meeting and I found I was the only one (of 7) that had no assignment from the priority list. When I questioned why I was put off the priority list, my manager said (these were the original words) “you can’t just work on something you like (referring to the project in conflict with parent company)”. But I was assigned to that work!
3. Situation became progressively worse towards end of October and early November. I felt being monitored. I started to receive company emails that had ""integrity issues"" in the titles whenever I met with a coworker in private or took a personal short break during the day. I also found my intranet connection to parent company (Nielsen) was disabled and IT failed to fix it for me.
4. I was of the same ethnical group with another employee in our team. I felt being put into an unseen competition with that person the entire time. But I didn’t have the advantage. I was brand new to the company to the industry but the other person was with the startup (later acquired by Nielsen) for 5 years. As a result, my existence in any project became sensitive and coworkers including senior ranks started to avoid me. Because of this I couldn’t learn properly the data and analytics system which was fatal to my work.
5. During the time I was at the company we moved to a newly renovated building. I, along with one other coworker, was seated right in front of two glass door conference rooms with real low cubicle walls. So as along as I sat in front of my computer and looked up I could see everything going on in those conference rooms and even their projected computer screens. This made me terribly uncomfortable combined with those “integrity issues” emails because it made me think I was the target.
6. I had some idea for the product work I was working on at that time and after discussing with senior ranks it seemed to be leading somewhere. But I received very negative and open reaction from the person mentioned in point 4 and quickly lost all the support. It got so bad the last week I was with the company that I didn’t feel safe to communicate with anyone through any channels. coworkers, especially those from my team, were avoiding me or avoiding to discuss work topics with me. I felt being framed to appear as an incompetent person while the reality was I was in an unfamiliar environment not being given guidance and learning opportunities.
7. There were many other things which I couldn’t even finish counting. Based on my experience, I highly suggest anyone to look away from this company and work elsewhere to save yourself, your family and your life.Show More","rethink your product offering, be more responsible for the role you are given, be nicer and more genuine"

Decent pay (but my pay was set by a smaller company that Nielsen acquired, and Nielsen has little choice but to maintain the existing salaries of talent they'd like to keep on — I suspect new Nielsen hires would make less for the same position).","Positively enormous con: they will work you like a dog. For the past year, I've worked at least 60 hours per week (with no additional compensation for that, of course), and I have zero work-life balance. I have no time to exercise; I barely interact with my family; and I live in a constant state of anxiety about not meeting the 5 big deadlines I have on any given week. Currently contemplating leaving because life …  quality is so poor—that is, if they don't lay me off first, which brings me to con #2...

Cost-cutting culture and massive layoffs: I receive a farewell note from someone I know about every other day now, informing me they've been let go. Many of these people are smart, very hard-working people. Morale is low as a result. Additionally, teams have become so lean that those of us left have three times as much work as one could reasonably accomplish. And there's no chance you can hire a freelancer or intern to help—because, well, your team has zero budget to spare.

Petty policies: Related to the above, Nielsen recently changed their policy to ""unlimited vacation,"" for the sole purpose of not having to pay out earned vacation days when people quit or are laid-off (and TONS of people are laid-off these days). Given how overworked everyone is, no one is going to use anything closed to unlimited vacation and, when we finally do quit (or get let go), Nielsen won't owe use a dime for all the days we earned but didn't get to take off. This screams of pettiness to me. It says you don't care at all about people who work like crazy for you, just as soon as you're done using them. Just pay people the vacation time they earned but never got to take, fair and square.

Weak or absent leadership in some areas: in my area of Nielsen, product leadership is strong, but commercial leadership is questionable. Leaders aren't present and taking accountability in many cases. When good leaders are promoted or move to a different team, those positions are often not back-filled anymore, so it's likely you'll end up reporting to someone less senior/experienced, which can impact how much you're learning and your own advancement at the company.

Not much faith in company's ability to turn things around: Nielsen moved too slowly for years and is scrambling to catch up and be more technology-driven. There are some big, promising initiatives in the pipeline that are supposed to be our salvation, but there's not much confidence about when they'll actually exist or about the people leading them. Nielsen doesn't have many leaders who are experienced in technology development, and they're stingy these days about hiring external talent. I think this is the wrong approach - the companies needs more new blood with different experience; more of the same people working on these totally new, technology-driven initiatives isn't going to cut it. To sum things up, when I was given the option, I didn't participate in the employee stock purchase plan. I honestly don't know if this company will turn itself around. Granted, it's a big ship and sinking it will take some time, but I don't know if it'll be able to plug the holes quickly enough.

This may have been a great company to work for once (and could maybe be again), but I would suggest that any prospective hires stay far away for awhile.Show More","Show that you actually care about people. Stop cutting benefits in petty ways. Reward those who work hard with recognition and actual compensation when it's deserved. (A $50 gift card to thank someone for giving up 100 hours of their personal time on a work project is nice, but... yeah, come on.) Get high-performing teams reasonable resources to handle the workload you throw at them so they don't end up having to …  give up everything in life that they care about outside of work, and eventually end up bitter and leaving the company.

Because it's tough to get households to agree with doing the survey, you should allow RI's some more flexibility with the script. All calls should be recorded.

Don't allow your RI that is more shy to feel left out. Be fair with all your RIs even those who aren't or are in your team. There were rules that were broken but certain TL's looked the other way.

Sit down and just talk to your RIs. If they are absent alot ask why.Retention rates would improve by getting to know your RI's better. I often felt invisible. I often felt like I could never please my TL, there was always something I did wrong. He was unapproachable at times. He always forgot about me. My first TL was amazing.

I've been with the company for 4+ years, joining out of college in the Professional Services division.

The pros are numerous:
1. Flexibility - manage your own timelines, work from home, work from anywhere you want really. As long as your work is done and on time, no one cares …  how, where, or when it's done.

2. Looks great on a resume - Nielsen opens the door to several options outside of Nielsen. Although you can find another role within Nielsen if you're feeling board, this is a company where you build skills that are transferable to numerous other companies and industries (CPG, Tech, Banking, Retail to name a few).

3. Leadership cares about people - at Nielsen you're an individual that's respected. Senior leadership cares about its people and take steps towards making sure you are trained to do your job and have the support you need.

4. Great colleagues - wonderful, smart people.

5. International opportunity if desired. If you work hard and express interest, there's plenty of positions to fill globally if that's what your corporate heart so desires.Show More","1. Despite being meritocracy driven, it can still feel like a timeline, even if you are a high performer. Analyst to Sr. Analyst is being pushed to 2 years instead of 1.5 years. People can get handed promotions just because they've been around long enough 2.5-3 years even if it means edging out a higher performer who's been around for only 1.5 years.

2. Workload can vary greatly depending on time of year and …  work/life balance is hard to maintain during peak seasons.

3. Although senior leadership is solid, middle management is spotty. There are some great managers, but some not so great either. It takes initiative to build relationships outside of your direct manager relationship.

4. Pay could be more competitive. One of the top reasons why people leave is because they can get 20-50% as much for similar role in another company.Show More","Continue to invest in people and technology. Work on training stronger middle management."

This problem could be minimized if interviewers were allowed to exercise a minimal degree of common sense ... It is very frustrating to receive a quality infraction when trying to manage a respondent who is reacting negatively to the survey format.

INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY!
1st- Quit buying all of these small companies that pop up in order to constantly feeding the machine of an MNC. Where is it getting Nielsen? Recruitment pitches are hard enough with people who haven't heard of Nielsen and then as soon as you tell them a big box will be …  hooked to their TV then good luck recovering. The recruitment pitch is a dance that could be so much smoother if the technology made sense for 2016. Apple made the Apple TV and the device is tiny and plugs right into the TV- we have a box the shape and size of an original Xbox with cords that make it look like a creature from the black lagoon.
2nd- Why are our systems for closing signs from the 1990's? Completely outdated and headache inducing upon any problem that arises.

Your employees could be even more efficient with better technology. You would save money through time saved and less headaches and higher job satisfaction. This shouldn't be as hard of a sell as it is sometimes and with a few investments, your ROI would happen as the basic rate increases!Show More"

"3886",2016-06-08,"Nielsen","US","Wilton, CT "," Senior Analyst","Current  ",NA,NA,"Yes","Negative","Yes",3,3,2,3,3,4,"The best reason, personally, to choose Nielsen is the people. Within each individual team, everyone seems to get along well (although some caveats below). People generally like their co-workers (not always their bosses) and it shows. At my office, there are a lot of team and office happy hours, organized sports, team volunteering and charity events, holiday celebrations and they usually all have pretty good …  participation. Even outside the office, its fairly common for co-workers to make plans or play sports.

One of the top reasons of working at Nielsen is that you get to work with and build up experience using Nielsen data and tools. The Nielsen name on a resume (speaking from my own experience) goes a long way with other employers. Almost every player in the Market Research industry relies on Nielsen (or less frequently its competitors) for some part of its data. Nielsen also is the only provider of scanning data, as well as the Nielsen Family data.

Nielsen is a large company so you get all of the perks that come with that. Decent individual health benefits, structured HR department, direct deposit, rotational opportunities across the business, minority-based networking groups, and frequent share-outs of the latest news in market research. Also, Nielsen is very accommodating with working from home or remotely, even at the VP+ level which would be tough to do at a smaller company.

Lastly, the infrastructure for modeling, pulling data from databases, data visualization, and for most things (i.e. my job) in general is very sophisticated and well developed. Many clients and other analytical firms can pull from the same data I use day to day, which makes database maintenance a top priority. Nielsen fields a very large developer base that supports it market research team in the US.Show More","Disclaimer: I would consider Nielsen closer to a 2.5 due to variability in how the teams are run, and the client your team is assigned

Some family benefits and compensation for many of the positions (even up to VP) are below what you would expect to make at a similar market analytics position. Managers I would say have it the worst compensation-wise compared to the industry.

Additionally, teams are …  VERY silo-ed and generally have their own culture due the all the acquisitions made by Nielsen. Cross-client work and sharing methodologies is quite rare as

Some teams(my team not included), the expectation is to work 70 hour weeks, holiday work sometime required. In this same office, they can see their peers leaving early in other teams for the same compensation. I can't say whether or not those co-workers who worked 70 hour weeks enjoyed working for Nielsen (although anecdotally turnover seems to be higher for this team), but I do think its somewhat unfair to have such drastic differences for the same analysis and projects. As a caveat, client cultural expectations do cause this to some large extent, but I believe lot of the burden is on management to set expectations correctly and not spread their analysts too thin.

If you plan on leaving the market research field, Nielsen is definitely a bit light on transferable software skills. Most of the tools used by Nielsen are proprietary and or web-based so if you leave for an industry that doesn't rely on Nielsen data, tools, or software, it could be a tough transition. Even other common market analytics programs such as R/Python, SAS, SQL are not utilized because the infrastructure is already so well developed.

Nielsen does have a hit-or-miss offshore team (as do most large companies), but they've definitely improved since I began working there.

My advice to anyone applying to Nielsen is ask a lot of questions about the culture of that particular team before moving forward as you would with any large company. Additionally, I would rate my team much higher than the company, and enjoyed most of the time I spent working here (I'm leaving due to things outside of their control such as location, compensation, and more office presence)Show More","Increase work collaboration or culture standardization across teams. The two measures in place, the cross-team rotational program and company happy hours, have not been too successful in my experience."

They will tell you that in the interview. A few new hires did not even last the first month on the job or even the first week.

However, if you have the self-discipline, time-management, and high people skills to be successful, this is a great opportunity. This is basically a field outside sales role where you aren't technically selling …  anything.

Pros:

Autonomy - You are basically remote and in the field so you schedule your own day. As long as you are hitting your weekly and monthly numbers and following procedure, you have immense freedom in your day.

Every day is different - You visit a huge range of residences from gated communities to public housing where the guards patrol with real fire arms. You meet so many different kinds of people and are invited inside their homes.

Opportunities for advancement - If you are very serious about your career it is relatively easy to be recognized and advance. Because it's similar to a sales role, it is a meritocracy and you will be promoted based on track record. If you don't want to ever be promoted, you can stay comfortably in your role until retirement (as long as you hit your numbers)

Company perks: Company vehicle with all maintenance and gas covered, company laptop, company cel, company credit card

Annual cost of living salary bump and annual performance review with potential raise.

At 5 years you get an anniversary celebration and are sent to Florida headquarters for a party.

It may vary by manager but using PTO is relatively easy and no one is discouraged from using it.Show More","Almost everything I listed above is a con if this job is not for you.

If speaking to a high volume of strangers and knocking on doors and entering unknown domiciles scares you, do not apply. If you need to be at an office where you are physically with your coworkers each day, do not apply.

You must keep expense and mileage reports and in general be on top of a lot of paperwork.

There is a LOT of …  driving and depending on your region for ""office meetings"" you may need to drive up to 2.5 hours and give up the whole day.

You have to work weekends and evenings (when people are more likely to be home). You still make your own schedule but this is not a 9-5/M-F role.

Since you are mostly unsupervised, the quality of the technical reps you work with may vary and your region may do things a little differently (not by the book) so it can be confusing and frustrating at times.

Nielsen is a grind. Compensation is poor, do not expect much, if anything, in the way of merit increases. They believe that working for the Nielsen name should be reward in itself and thus pay below market. Management is full of ex-GE folks, and they execute the GE playbook to the letter, with less than stellar results. They have a bunch of newly minted MBAs running the place (Nielsen likes to find …  cheap labor at all levels) with no real work experience, whom they rotate around the business in various training opportunities. When it comes time to be accountable for something, lacking real business experience, they fall back on bullying tactics or delegate down the chain until the work goes to some low-level employee who has no ability to execute and gets blamed when things go badly. They do not believe or practice work-life balance, so don’t expect to see any. They treat the Data Acquisition side of their business as a commodity, and take a factory approach to it. If you work in Data Acquisition, expect to be treated like a second class citizen. Since Nielsen acquired Arbitron, Arbitron went from being a gem of a company with stellar data acquisition metrics to extremely poor results as a direct result of the Nielsen folks calling the shots. Arbitron had very mature, analytical and thoughtful leaders who knew how to run a business and manage people to get the most out of them. But the Nielsen folks were the smartest people in the room post-merger, so it was useless to tell them they were sacrificing short term gains at the expense of long term performance. So, for the sake of achieving a $20MM “synergy” target through layoffs, it will likely cost them $20MM or more to fix the damage that was done to performance as a result. Speaking of short term gains, a lot of the “smartest people in the room” in senior leadership left Nielsen shortly after the acquisition of Arbitron, leaving others to clean up the mess and take the blame for abysmal performance, and thus avoiding the stain of failure from appearing on their resumes. I am the world’s biggest believer in Capitalism, but the Nielsen treatment of Arbitron post-merger is an example of the worst of American business, and they are paying the price for incompetent leadership.Show More","Is there anyone left in management who is willing to be accountable for anything?

The field representative jobs paid well and included great perks like a company car, $50 per month toward Internet expenses, a company cell phone and laptop and top of the line health insurance.

Unfortunately cost cutting company wide has …  resulted in cuts in benefits, increases in workload and reduction in staffing to the point that most field representatives work 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to get the minimum job requirements completed.

Homes that agree to participate in the sample are called co-operators or co-ops. Our own agreement with these homes states they can stop participation any time that they want. But that is a lie! Homes will contact you and state “I want you to pick up the equipment for…..” ie its bulky and ugly(it is), you call me all the time (we do), you have been to my house 4 times in the last 6 months (it likely), its causing my TV to not work properly (again its likely), you just don’t pay me enough for all the hassle involved (we don’t).

But management will in most cases not let you simply do what the panel agreement between the co-oprating household and the company says which is end their participation at any time. You will be asked to lie to the home, avoid contact with the home or schedule an appointment to pick up the equipment more than 2 months away. If the home gets tired of waiting for you to get the equipment, and unplugs it all? Then the home faults for 60 days affecting your performance numbers negatively and lowering your yearly performance evaluation.

Local management knows the goals that are set are unsustainable but they are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their own job so when an employee falls behind on work that is becoming increasingly impossible to complete on time and to required standards local management instead of pushing for more headcount to even out workloads throws the employees under the bus and terminates them for failure to complete job expectations.

One employee worked 50+ hours per week in 2015 and received a job evaluation of 3 out of 4 possible points. Not too bad right? Wrong he was then informed that if he performed the same in 2016 they would only be rated a 2 out of 4.

How is it possible that the same performance this year as last year could result in a lower performance evaluation? The company uses a 10-70-20 grading scale for employees in each local market. That means 10% can be graded 4, 70% can be graded 3 and 20% must be graded 2 or 1. That means if there are 7 employees to manage a 600 home NSI market and a 80 home NPM market that only 1 employee can be rated a 4, 4 can be graded 3 and that 2 must be graded a 2 or a 1. Regardless of actual job performance.

Don’t get me wrong the job sounds amazing. Work from home, self-scheduling and a flexible schedule. A company car, phone and laptop.

But remember if your working 50 to 60 hours a week with weekend work expected as well how much free time are you going to have?

There are better companies out there to work for with better management and a much better work life home life balance.

STOP cutting field force. There are already too many homes per field representative and its only getting worse. at last count I was responsible for almost 100 homes.Show More"

If you want to spend every waking moment doing your job, this is the place for you. If you don't lose sleep over the possibility that you could get fired because somebody didn't notify you when they threw out an old, broken TV, then you've really got it made! You may think this is just sour grapes, but unfortunately it's very real!","Do you think it's reasonable to expect every random person, without any compensation, to notify you of every electronic device they get or get rid of, every time they get one or get rid of one? And not just your friends, we're talking about EVERY kind of person, because ALL kinds of people live in Nielsen sample homes. ALL kinds. Some of them are criminals, reckless, or just ignorant. Nielsen expects this model to …  work, and if you're caught with something documented wrong - a forgotten broken old DVD player stored in the closet, perhaps; or they changed from having a Droid phone to having an iPhone - this is a damning failure and it's YOUR fault, and YOU pay the consequences.

These unreasonable expectations lead to several chronic problems: wildly inaccurate data being reported to Nielsen's clients, institutionalized lying (it's impossible to maintain acceptable performance numbers without lying), and middle-management who is keenly aware of the fact that EVERY Nielsen home has at least one trifling detail like these wrong, because even the nicest, most cooperative people who have agreed to be a Nielsen Ratings home forget about some device they have, or forget to tell you about some change they make, or just generally don't understand what they're agreeing to with Nielsen, or how it works. Supervisors use this as a weapon, without any check or balance (appeal process, etc) to keep their employees obedient - if someone gets out of line, all the manager has to do is visit any Nielsen home in that Rep's territory to dig up enough dirt to punish that employee until he either gets in line or gets out.

Even without that situation, the equipment is horribly antiquated and prone to failures - some of which are the type that require weekly visits to homes to ensure that it's reporting data the best it can, which isn't very well (someone who leaves the TV on all the time but turns the cable box off, for example, needs to be contacted by phone and in person weekly).

Forget about work/life balance, this job requires every waking moment because there is always a flag due date or high-priority fault hanging over your head that must be dealt with as soon as possible - nights, weekends, holidays, whenever a Nielsen home will let you in. And they could call at any moment and demand you come to help them with something - RIGHT NOW! Either that, or they don't want to be a Nielsen home anymore and want you to remove the equipment and stop calling them - and that, of course, is totally unacceptable performance on your part, according to your supervisor, and you will be held accountable. And don't expect to be done with work once you get home. No, you have an exceptionally slow and convoluted documentation rats-nest to sit in front of your laptop and work on for 1-3 hours every day. Not every work day... EVERY day. And hopefully, all your changes will get permanently recorded, because if something fails to update, as is prone to happen, the discrepancy is YOUR fault, and YOU pay the consequences.

If you're good at brown-nosing, however, your supervisor will not check after you very often, and when he does he will be far more likely to overlook those inevitable problems of yours, like when somebody tried to watch a DVD and couldn't get it to show up on their TV, so they unplugged the Nielsen tap from their DVD player and never called to tell you.Show More","Time to find another core competency. Media rating is going the way of the stagecoach. Local media can't afford you.

Everything is aimed at making employees fail sooner (or, rarely, later), including byzantine software applications which fail regularly, like at least once a week, and require hours …  and hours on the phone with PC Support or just waiting until someone else slogs through the issue reporting and then getting it fixed. They pride themselves on being modern, up to date, technology inclined, but all of this takes much, much, much longer to do the job.

They claim to promote based on merit but then don't interview every person that applies for a job and choose old white men for jobs over people with metrics twice as good as the old white men.
Once an employee is promoted to full-time the benefits are expensive and cover nothing. No one ever receives raises except those special people recruited for the 'fast track' to management. Another slap in the face to people who work hard but are passed over and ignored.

Nielsen is involved in a lot of different things, if you feel like …  networking a bunch and fight your way out of CPG/Analytics/Cincinnati, you can. But it's 100% on you.
It's an OK place to start after college, but don't over stay your welcome: 2-3 yrs then move on if you can.
It's ok to be openly looking for jobs here. Everyone else is.Show More","I can only speak for my direct team from my personal experience. Keep in mind Nielsen is a big place and there are certainly ppl who had better experience than I during their time here. Don't take my word for it, talk to people, do your own research and look at other reviews!
1. Mngmt changes often and can be very political. The ""balance of power"" means rarely people would step on anyone's toes to help you out. …  If you get assigned to a not so great mnger...just your luck. Also the company is split into two locations, don't be surprised if you don't see your mnger/director or co workers for months at a time. Not enough attention is put on how to solve real growing pains like how to remedy the lack of off cycle training (I think some other reviews have mentioned, and I agree, onboarding is a joke here), how to deal with the high turnover, how to grow young analysts into mngers etc. The changes that have been put into place are often not well executed. Training for new tools and even the tools themselves often won't be available until the week you need them. While uppermngt already promised client shorten cycle time causing stress on the analysts. The lack of proper execution is overlooked as mngmt hurry to celebrate success, and move on to their next big role.
3.Directors are often soft when negotiating with the client. The skill to influence is just simply not there.This puts more work on the mnger and the analysts, causing extra pressure and stress during time of delivery. On the flip side, clients are actually well trained on how to push for things. Don't be surprised if you are dealing with a demanding client and don't feel like you have a good internal support network.
3. Hours are less than ideal. For six months out of the year you are about 60% capacity, and for the other six: 120%. I didn't mind it much but I've seen other ppl with families who are frustrated because they don't get to spend time with their young kids. That's the high stress nature of the job, which is fine, except when I interviewed, the work life balance was an actual selling point.
4. You will be rated here which is absolutely fair. However the way you are presented at these calibration sessions are entirely opaque, especially at the analyst level. By the time you get your feedback, the budget is already set for the year. Mngmt can also be very unforgiving towards circumstances the mngmt put you in, for example: someone got hired on mid year into a team with high turnovers with a not so great mnger and minimal training has to do as well as anyone else. So if you stay, do yourself a favor and talk to your mnger/director in the month of SEPT and make sure they represent you fairly. Even then, don't be surprised if you don't get a raise and no one gives you a honest explanation. You are going to get rotated next year anyways. What incentive does anyone have to fight for your development? Just FYI, when you do get promoted, you will be called a ""spok"" where you do mnger work for analyst pay for at least a year to prove yourself. Also the actual managerial training is optional. So big surprise! People who are stat nerds, aren't always great mngers, and people who would make good mngers...probably moved on already.
5. Which brings me to my next point, expect your incoming class to be mostly gone when they are able to take away the 401K match if not before. Of course there are personal reasons etc etc, but one HUGE reason is that the standard compensation here is not competitive enough to make people who are truly driven and are truly good with data to stay. The tools we use right now is automated in many ways and will continue to evolve in that direction, so think about your exiting strategy: are you serious about analytics? If so, you will learn more serious stat application elsewhere AND get paid more. Why would you stay? If you are not super into stats, but got a great business mind, every other vendor/retailer out there is looking for business analyst who knows Nielsen data and offers 30% upside. Why would you stay? Of course there are exceptions! Don't take my word for it, ask your hiring mnger: what % of people here have been w/ the firm for more than 3-5 yrs, and just know that there is a reason for this.
6. Ideally HR's goal is to make you to feel like you are part of a team and have this highly cohesive environment. That would be great except the current HR partner is thousands of miles away and only returns your e-mail about 30% of the time (still better than some VPs/directors here) and can't seem to remember anything you said. At this point you have a pretty horrible work life balance, doing mnger work for analyst pay, and all your friends are gone. Say you don't care about any of that and still want to trust the mngmt and drink the cool-aid ... be aware when you negotiate and make sure you have the upper mngmt's promises down in writing, don't be unpleasantly surprised in the end. OR, just be smart and take your 401K match and move on.Show More","Bring back the onsite HR partner! The current personnel is less than helpful."

Work is unfairly distributed between employees.
Most employees are part-time and have the 'carrot' of full-time dangled in front of them and never get better pay or benefits. The benefits package is an expensive joke and pay raises are rarely given out to anyone. They have a PPR system for rating yearly performance and it's out of 4 points. No one ever gets 4 points, so it's impossible to feel valued.
Departments are disbanded and the people are told to apply to other jobs within Watch Ops but usually have to leave. I assume this is so Nielsen can avoid paying severance.
How can a company that makes billions of dollars a year justify not paying employees well and having a huge outsourcing contract to India? Men in the office make sexist and disgusting comments and aren't reprimanded. People move up in the company not by actually working hard but by sucking up, and doing extracurricular activities like newsletters that no one reads.

-Your direct manager …  essentially determines your career path in the company (so if you're not harbored in the shelter of their favor, then you will remain in the PT role.)

-Offers little room to advance beyond being a FT non-managerial employee.

-Talent and ideas are dismissed by pretentious head managers.

-No uniformed methodology for tracking errors (your errors are based on the mood of your “trainer”) Not fair when you're a new hire.

-Too cheap to buy a coffee maker in the break room; (however can pay execs top $ in quarterly bonuses.)

-Emerging leaders are favored over new grads. (Unless you go through the program, your degree is not valued.)

-Policies are not upheld by all of the management team.

-There is no set communication between HR and Dept. Management. (This makes it difficult when setting appointments and phone calls.)

-Some employees are given more repetitively challenging roles over others. This makes promotions easier for some and harder for others because metrics are looked at heavily.

-Did not cross train a decent amount of people so you may have only 3 people out of about 40 who know how to complete the task. This limits you in work schedule flexibility to pretty much none.

- There is a good chance that if any system has been in production for more than 2 years, than there is no one left in the company who understands it.

Analytics Training
I started at Nielsen BASES (innovation services) and knew almost nothing about analytics or …  the CPG (consumer packaged goods) instrucy. Thankfully, I had done well at college and so I was hired for my potential, not my in depth knowledge of marketing research. Although the initial adjustment to the company was rough, I learned a great deal from analyzing syndicated data, to forecasting to products, to consulting with brand teams about how to improve their new product launches. If you are looking for a company that will help to teach you how to analyze and create a story from data, Nielsen is a solid place to start.

Good Environment with Coworkers
By and large, the employees that I interact with have been very friendly, bright and capable people. People at the company are largely the kind of people that I like to befriend or hang out with after work. Overall, I feel myself becoming smarter because of the people I work with.

Strong Company Name Recognition
As you might know, Nielsen is one of the largest marketing research companies in the world and has a tremendous strategic position. Nearly all scanned products in the United States are sent to just two companies, IRI and Nielsen. Anyone who has studied marketing in-depth or has dealt with consumer products (things you could buy at a Walmart) knows Nielsen. As someone who was unemployed several months after college, I continue to be amazed at how quickly and easily coworkers can find jobs once they have Nielsen on the resume.Show More","Although Nielsen is an good place to launch an analytics or marketing research career, the company provides few incentives to stay with the company. As such, the vast majority of talented employees leave the company after 3 or 4 years, especially in departments such as sales forecasting (BASES) and Mixed Market Modeling (Custom Analytics). The reasons for this high turnover include weak onboarding process, …  difficulty moving around within the company, the technical nature of the work, poor work/life balance, and insufficient compensation. My examples below will primarily address the forecasting branch of Nielsen.

Onboarding
Although Nielsen has made good gains in terms of training new hires, the adjustment to work is still very rough. The current best practice includes giving a new analyst a large project, preferably one that requres concept and product analysis, a project that takes over a month to complete. This means that most people work long hours to complete the first project and learn quickly, while a meaningful minority do not catch on quick enough and are usually let go within the first year or two.

Moving within the Company
Although some individuals are able to move from department to department, most find this challenging. In order to move, you need to prove that 1) you are valuable enough to stay with the company but 2) not too valuable that your manager doesn't want to you to leave the team. Often people leave the company because they are not able to get out of their current department to a different part of Nielsen.

Technical Work
The work that Nielsen does can be quite exacting and detail oriented. Some leave simply because they don't like marketing research, forecasting or analysis.

Work/Life Balance
As with any project-based supplier, the Nielsen forecasting department has difficulties keeping a good work/life balance. If you are assigned a large project, you have to simply work hard until it is completed. This can mean working 60+ hours per week when things are busy. If you have firm commitments in the evenings and need a definite 8-5 job, this is probably not a good fit for you.

Insufficient Compensation
Nielsen salaries are competitive for new college hires, but pay increases are meager as you spend time working for the company. At the same time, the experience that you get an Nielsen is quite valuable. A number of my coworkers leave Nielsen after three or four years because they can take a 25% pay increase to work somewhere else. Nielsen currently does not have a strong compensation program to keep talented individuals at the company, especially when they have been at Nielsen for over three years.Show More","While most Nielsen managers are doing their best to manage the situation, many issues can be addressed through a few simple steps.
1) Hire based on historical turnover rates. Currently a position is not filled unless someone leaves the company. Unfortunately, finding a new employee and training them to be as productive as the previous employee, will take at least a year. This means that the rest of the team works …  over-time during that period, causing further burnout. Since the vast majority of employees leave the company by 3 years, Nielsen should hire new employees at a steady rate to back-fill spots and reduce long hours and unneeded employee burnout.
2) Allow better inter-departmental transfers. Although a person might not be great at forecasting, he or she could still be a valuable asset to the company. The current process makes it difficult to move between departments, meaning that Nielsen often loses talented employees needlessly.Show More"

Plenty of big data challenges, most of them unique enough to require custom development at just about every level. As technology and consumption habits continue to evolve, there is constant pressure to continuously improve our scope and capabilities. Current leadership under Dave Calhoun has placed Nielsen in a much more …  sustainable financial position than it has been in for decades.
The work/live balance has really shifted for the better, most managers allowing working remotely.Show More","Unfortunately, some of the decisions on technology partners has lead to an unending stream of inexperienced technologists. This leads to poor workmanship and thus, poor build quality. To combat this, Nielsen management has instituted a monstrous bureaucracy that tends to stifle innovation. Also worth mentioning, our infrastructure team is completely outsourced. Since doing so, that team has suffered greatly, and has …  bogged innovation down quite a bit. Nothing gets done unless it's an emergency and is pushed to the top of the stack by upper management, which is no doubt stressful on the infrastructure teams as well.
Additionally, since the bulk of the employees now seem to be made up of consultants, there is a distinct lack of company culture. The concept of company loyalty is all but evaporated after a series of ""work force optimizations"" (read: layoffs).
Finally, performance reviews are (as with most companies it seems), mostly a joke. You write your own goals, you criticize yourself, and then your manager meets with you one time for the year and agrees or disagrees. There needs to be a higher focus on monthly or at least quarterly reviews to communicate better about your performance. There is no division of technical and people manager roles, which usually leads to middle management being too overwhelmed with technology meetings and workload to really engage their employees.Show More","Upper management should continue to in the direction it is headed, de-leveraging where it can. However, middle management needs to continue this new focus on hiring top talent to tackle these enormous issues we face. Consider using consulting partners for areas where innovation is less critical. Keep innovation and technology leadership in-house. Really take a close look at our infrastructure partners, and consider …  if they are capable enough to carry us into future.

Not much stress, but not much motivation either. Nielsen has become more professional than it used to be, but there are still a few fundamental issues.","Nielsen offers too many products & services, and client-facing personnel are expected to learn how to sell and/or use each one of them. This results in a climate where people know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be truly respected by our clients. I wouldn't doubt if Nielsen spins off some of them. They've been in acquisition mode for a long time, but it can't last.

Another con is that they …  engaged in an outsourcing initiative a few years ago, trying to identify ""low level"" work that could be done by TCS personnel in India. The idea is fine, but in practice it's rather lacking. The problem is that TCS has little day-to-day interaction with stateside personnel, so a gap exists that hinders understanding of objectives & needs. This forces us to use a detailed order form to request their assistance. And when they complete their work it needs to be proofed, and often modified to be more client-presentable (due to grammar, knowledge of client issues & culture, etc). So it often takes more time than it would if you had done the whole project yourself. So now Nielsen is paying for 2 individual's time, when it could have only paid 1.

At most other consulting firms, there is a staff of junior analysts or interns available, right here in America, and you could simply call them or walk over to their desk and say ""Hey, you remember that project you did last month, could you do it exactly like that but for a different brand"", and they would understand exactly what to do, without needing an order form telling them. And their output would be more client-ready due to a better understanding of English as well as domestic custom. Not to mention that these analysts would provide a steady pool of promotion-ready personnel. In contrast, the average TCS person only sticks around for 18 months, from what I've heard.

Also, Nielsen has developed many presentation ""templates"" over the years, that are supposed to take data and plop it into a standardized deck. The problem is, most of those templates are very unprofessional looking. I'm talking simple things like grammar, and making sure that the margins and font sizes are the same on each page. They would never pass standards at Accenture or McKinsey or all those other consulting firms Nielsen hopes to emulate. The same goes for many of the sales and training decks. Many of them look really amateur.Show More","Stop trying to apply General Electric organizational models on a business that lies within an entirely different industry. Promote internal people who already understand how to do things, instead of hiring external candidates just because they worked for an impressive CPG or consulting firm.

Managers merely delegate work and keep track of deadlines. That's not adding much value. To be a leader, you also need to inspire your team, motivate them, and recognize them.

1. Outsourcing galore. You WILL lose your job sooner or later. Nearly everyone I ever worked with at Nielsen has either been laid off or has left the company of their own accord.

So all of that hard work was for nothing. Rinse & Repeat for the next big project, and the next one, and the next one. One person is asked to do the workload of 2 or 3, which also means that you are so deeply entrenched in your role that there is no opportunity to do anything new.

Benefits are terrible--They only match 1/2 of your 401k contribution which vests after 3 years. Health insurance has a $1000 deductible. This …  makes it impossible to work here if you have kids or ever plan on retiring. Pay is also on the low end.

Highly political atmosphere. Because they hire an army of young people, supervisors do not critically evaluate performance. Instead they rely on superficial traits and biased feedback from directors.

I never really had the chance to work with people who were really experienced and knew a lot about the industry. All the people I interacted with were young folks hired out of college with no real-world experience.

- So much of the work has been outsourced to India - this transition has been rough as the ability of our counterparts really varies. Quality may suffer as a result.
- Definite favoritism in the organization
- Management ability really …  varies. Some can be great analysts and consultants, but they may make horrible managers.
- Too many new processes that the staff has to learn; innovation is great, but it forces too much change too soon. There is little change management process.
- There is a lot of training, but much of it is not substantive
- Surprisingly, this company has the worst IT I've ever experienced; everyone has plenty of help desk issues when they start the job, and some new hires don't even get a laptop on day one. (It took me a few months to get mine)

"5625",2011-08-04,"Nielsen","US","Cincinnati, OH "," Senior Analyst","Current  ",NA,NA,"No",NA,"No",1,1,1.5,NA,1,1,"1) The Nielsen name is still respected by clients and other potential employers so it's not a bad name to have on your resume.
2) Since Nielsen likes to buy stuff and cozy up to whoever they can make the most money off of, there are opportunities available to try different things and move to different offices (if you are willing to look for the opportunity yourself).
3) You get experience using tools and data …  that will be of value to other companies should you decide to leave.
4) You get to work with SOME people who are really smart AND fun.
5) In this office, dress code is business causal or just plain casual (during the summer) which saves you money on dry cleaning and time getting ready in the morning.
6) Free parking is available if you don't mind walking which will also save you money.Show More","1) Unfortunately Nielsen has no desire to retain or develop its people, so the future of your career is in your own hands. It is difficult to get even direct managers interested in helping you plan the next step of your career. Long story short if you are not up for the challenge do not overstay your welcome or take that offer you got from that other company and save yourself the headache.
2) Onboarding is kind …  of a joke. If you like a good challenge EVERYDAY and love the ""struggle"" or ""sink or swim"" method of learning this could be the place for you, but I'd say everyone becomes overwhelmed by the amount of self learning that is required to get up and running at this place in the beginning.
3) Management leaves a lot to be desired as well. Nielsen likes to promote from within and in many cases has taken someone who was a good analyst and promoted them into a people manager position. As you may have guessed from the point above, Nielsen doesn't provide the most comprehensive training, so most of these managers have no formal training nor have they had the time to engage in extracurricular activities that would have taught them the leadership skills to be good managers of people. Managers are also not required to complete advanced degrees such as MBAs to be promoted to management positions. All of this adds up to: you could get lucky and have one of the few managers who just inherently ""gets it"" or be prepared to manage your manager every day of your career (this is far more likely to be the case).
4) Work/life balance is not valued at Nielsen - you will work long, unpredictable hours at times.You will not work less than 40 hours a week unless you are on vacation and you will likely never actually get to use sick time. You will be working through flu season even if you are doing it at home with a fever. Just plan on giving up your hobbies, friends, and free time before you start. There are basically three schools of thought on work/life balance at Nielsen: 1) ""I do care that you worked late so don't bother mentioning it"" 2) "" I worked long hours when I was the lower man on the totem pole so I don't see why you shouldn't too"" and 3) ""We pay you to be here not the other way around so you should be grateful to have a job"". There may be a few people who say work life balance is good, but I doubt they are hitting their revenue goals for the year.
5) Compensation is great if you are fresh out of school; in fact starting salary is not really far off entry level salary at many leading companies. However, while other companies give healthy raises and bonuses each year, Nielsen does not. So prepare for the disappointment of learning your friend who took that job at that other company makes a bunch more money than you after a couple of years. Also, if you come in with experience or an advanced degree you WILL be underpaid (paid like the people straight out of school), yet you will be expected to do more and do it faster. Don't expect promotions, raises, and bonuses to be handed out. Be thankful if you ever get one because they are few and far between...supposedly we are a meritocracy but have seen no evidence of this. Nielsen has an inconsistent, arbitrary way of evaluating employees to justify not rewarding them. Make sure you negotiate for a better starting salary and ask for a signing bonus before you sign that offer letter.
6) Nielsen has a really strange culture that is constantly changing and not for the better. At the helm you have some former GE folks who love implementing BPI to make more of whatever you are selling in a shorter amount of time, outsourcing stuff to save a buck, and forcing out what they have determined to be the bottom 10% out of the company. Combine that with the fact the company itself is a hodgepodge of smaller companies that were merged with Nielsen or acquired by Nielsen and you have numerous subcultures that don't exactly play nice together. Its like the craziest three-legged race you can image where the participants can't seem to find their stride.
7) While employees at other companies may complain that they have old outdated systems that aren't updated because their leadership believes ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"", Nielsen is a fan of ""it's been more than 60 seconds since we tried to improve something for no good reason"". Once you've mastered a system, tool, or process, it's just a matter of time before you have to relearn a completely new version of something that accomplishes the same end. Any time savings that could have been realized by the new tool or process is lost during the time you have to figure out how to use or implement the new tool or process. Nothing is intuitive. It will take multiple tries to get up to speed, and right about THAT time a new version of what you just mastered will roll out and you get to start the learning process all over again.Show More","Your people are your greatest asset. To get the best out of your employees you need to inspire them by creating an environment where people want to work, give them the tools to do their jobs, compensate them fairly for their work, and invest in their continued development. In this win- win situation, employees work hard to grow the business and in turn the business further develops and rewards employees so that they …  are happy and contribute even more to the organization.Show More"

They want to become an academy company (think GE, Proctor & Gamble), yet there is little movement or opportunity within Nielsen Mobile. Guess it would be ok, right out of college and you didn't know any better. As a seasoned professional....run the other way.

No respect for employees.

Upper management is so far removed from the actual day-to-day operations and they believe that everything is wonderful, and ignore the bad. Most of upper management is waiting of Nielsen to go public and collect their windfall and high-tail it out of there.

The survey process is so slow that it takes 6 months to get an update into a survey. Want to add the latest cell phone app information to your survey? Well you will have to wait through two quarter cycles until that information is being asked to the market. Nielsen Mobile's data is way behind the curve and typically outdated.

Management tends to tackle the same issues over and over again by starting a project, having it fail, waiting a few months and trying it again with a new name. It's a never ending cycle.

No morale left in the office. They keep creating employee engagement teams, that are really there just to pat upper management on the back and say ""look we are doing a good job"". People in the trenches are miserable, underpaid, and under-appreciated, yet upper management either is clueless or just does not care.

HR is clueless and worthless. When you ask a question about benefits, pay, or anything for that matter, they do not have an answer for you.

Forte autonomie","Impossible de se projeter plus de 2/3 ans car la politique globale n'est pas à la rétention des salariés... Et derrière une fausse préoccupation RH, rien n'est fait pour résoudre ce problème alors qu'il dure depuis des années ! J'ai croisé des anciens Nielsen qui ont travaillé comme consultant il y a 10/20 ans et leur diagnostic est étrangement similaire.

1°) Le salaire. Plutôt performant à l'embauche en …  sortant d'école (38K à mon époque, 35 bientôt avec leur réorganisation...) les évolutions de salaire sont quasi inexistantes. En 3/4 ans chez les consultants juniors, rares sont ceux qui prennent plus de 2K. Ajoutez à cette frustration le taux de charge totalement dément (il faut retirer quasi 30% entre le brut et le net contre 23% pour la moyenne des cadres en France) qu'on ne nous précise pas à l'embauche...et vous comprendrez que vous ne venez décidément pas chez Nielsen pour y faire carrière. A moins d'aimer travailler pour la gloire et de ne faire que peu de considérations de l'aspect financier.
2°) Cela rejoint le précédent point sur le salaire mais Nielsen est la seule boite à ma connaissance qui ne semble pas juger bon d'attribuer une part variable dans la rémunération chez les commerciaux. Résultats : vous vendez, parfois des études très coûteuses...et vous n'avez aucun incentive dessus. Super motivant... Mais où va donc l'argent ? Car attention Nielsen est très rentable !
3°) Ni intéressement ni participation. Idem avec le point précédent, on est contents de voir que la boîte se porte bien, connait une belle croissance...et on regrette de ne rien toucher sur les bénéfices.
4°) Les locaux ET la localisation géographique : un sujet ENFIN en passe d’être traité car un déménagement est dans le pipe pour début d’année 2019. Ce qui prouve que les employés peuvent être finalement entendus. Les locaux actuels sont vétustes, vieillissants et certaines parties tombent même en ruine. A ce sujet, la rengaine chez Nielsen (jugez-vous-même du ridicule) c’est de dire « non mais comprenez, on se fait de la maille sur le dos des clients – il faut que lorsqu’ils viennent chez nous (ie pour des formations panels ou logiciels), ces gens ne trouvent pas que notre cadre de vie soit trop indécent…autrement ils seraient tentés de penser que nous sommes trop grassement payés ». Bon, de là à travailler dans ces conditions il y a encore un monde. Même constat pour la localisation : Cergy c’est à la limite de la Picardie, au bout du bout du RER A sur une branche qui est plus souvent défectueuse qu’en bon état de marche. Résultat, des heures perdues dans les transports, une forte irritabilité au quotidien et un ras-le-bol général. Je ne vais pas m’étendre sur la ville de Cergy qui est d’une laideur sans commune mesure (pour la partie Cergy Pref en tout cas) avec une population que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs et dans laquelle vous ne vous sentirez jamais en grande sécurité  bon courage en tant que femme pour rentrer chez vous de Cergy en RER A vers 20 ou 21h pour peu que vous vous soyez fait une petite nocturne.
5°) La charge de travail : très disparate entre les consultants (personne ne comprend comment la répartition a été faite), certains (dont je faisais partie) enchainent les nocturnes et le travail le WE pour suivre un rythme de présentation soutenu…pendant que d’autres ont 3 ou 4 prez dans l’année et déconnectent à 17h45… Cela ne semble pas poser de problème au top management malgré les discussions régulières à ce sujet et les explosions en vol (quelques burnouts, de plus en plus rares cela dit).
6°) GO DIGITAL : gros projet Nielsen depuis le début 2017 qui a entrainé une profonde réorganisation. Résultat : un poste de consultant marketing qui avait autrefois la richesse d’être analytique, commercial et de demander une gestion quotidienne des clients va aujourd’hui se scinder en 3 postes mono-tâche  une personne sera chargée d’empiler les analyses et les présentations, une autre de répondre aux questions day to day des clients (whaou super valorisant n’est-ce pas ?), et une dernière de l’aspect financier et commercial. A force de vouloir chercher l’efficacité à tout prix en découpant méthodiquement les tâches, ne va-t on pas parodier les Temps Modernes de Chaplin ? Les employés risquent de s’abrutir à exercer la même tâche tous les jours et le cloisonnement imputé peut les couper de toute vision transversale et stratégique indispensable à leur motivation sur le long terme.Show More","Prendre en considération tout ce que vous remontent les employés depuis des années...

I heard about TNS from a friend who worked at the company. They were looking for new Telephone Interviewers so I rang the company and they took my details. I then attended an assessment day where there were team-building exercises such as introducing yourself and …  moral scenarios. You are not paid for this two day training and you are only give 30 minutes lunch time for a day lasting from 10am-5.30pm.

Once I passed the assessment centre I was put to work on the call-centre floor,which was exciting at first as with all new roles. However after working there for a couple of weeks, I realized a few things.

A) The environment of this workplace is very demotivating! The supervisors look like they hate their job, which in turn demotivates the staff.
B) I asked my new colleagues if they enjoyed their job and everyone I asked hated the job or said that it was an ok place to work. You are assigned seating randomly in different colored sections so you sit next to new people all the time.
C) The amount of abuse you receive is not worth the minimal £6.30 pay. Strike Rates are next to impossible to achieve due to slow-diallers, answerphones and fax machines. Of course the presence is that every 1 in 10 person will do an interview. This is nonsense.
D) I came across graduates and people who were wasting their lives with this company. Most of the time you are perceived as a nuisance caller even if you are ringing on behalf of the government!

If you are looking for to be treated as a person, this is NOT the company for you. And if you are a school leaver, graduate or a part-time self-employed person this company is only looking to exploit people into doing fast-paced labour at minimal cost. I quit in the end, because it wasn't worth my time or intelligence.Show More","A) Pay your staff more.
B) Improve working conditions. Not the worst i've seen, but certainly a sweat box smelling of Pot Noodle.

I think that it has added some unnecessary bureaucracy to the whole research process. There were squabbles over which department is supposed to be doing what task, but if teams spent that time just doing the task it would have been done!

Despite the fact that I spoke of low levels of job satisfaction and had demonstrated that I would have thrived int he department. A lot of my colleagues left the company because they were not given the opportunity to transfer.

A lot of time/money/effort is wasted on process, filling in additional forms, updating all the additional systems and I understand that a business so large has to have some regulation, but there are instances where it becomes inefficient and costly and there is a lot of that on projects.Show More","All of the regulation in an effort to make the company efficient has in fact made it very inefficient.

It makes the …  job boring, and the company as a whole less desirable.

I also think that it is important to give junior employees the room to explore and see what it is that they are interested in doing, what they are good at.

The company does realise its fault and from what I hear they are taking steps to improve on their shortcomings. They honestly have great HR policies on paper but the people in the …  Sydney office (back when I was working there a few year ago) just did not care to execute these policies properly.
available as well as a day off for your birthday.Show More","Terrible execution of HR policies. It is meant to be one of the best companies to work for because they have some many great perks on paper but the actual treatment by management is appalling. If you are sick and want to take a sick day, it is frowned upon. While working there, I was so sick I had to have surgery and the recommended down time was minimum 2 weeks. After 1 week, I got a call from my manager asking me …  go back into work even though I had applied and was approved 2 weeks of sick leave. When I finally went back into work, I had to have an HR interview with pay roll because they were not happy that I had to take 2 weeks off (again, I have to stress that my leave was approved). To add insult to injury (no pun intended), I was one of the best employees at the time, receiving multiple awards and gifts from clients. I would always stay late and take on extra projects but this apparently was not enough to warrant me some time off to recover from surgery. They are not only stingy on sick leave, they are also very strict with their annual leave. By law in Australia, you are allowed 4 weeks of annual leave. However if you try to take anymore than 2 weeks and you are told off for it. Senior managers are allowed first preference on when they can take leave and it works down from there.

Below average pay: The pay in itself is fairly insulting as well. Market Research doesn't pay that well, but their pay is below average. I feel the company justifies this by providing free perks (like cake, beer and fruit) but honestly, they have to realise that these are extra perks and not a part of the pay package.

Poor corporate culture: Unfortunately with such below average pay (in Sydney anyway), it can't attract many quality applicants. This is a market research firm so basic understanding of stats is a must. However, I have had a co-worker ask me what a ""standard deviation"" means and she's been working as a project manager for 2 years. There is a very great discrepancy between the intellectual level of employees. During my time there, I have worked with 2 PhDs and a number of extremely talented managers, but the majority of people there are not very bright. In fact, I had to cut short an overseas trip because my manager didn't have the skill set to do some analysis and I had to come back early to help her do it.

Lack of onboarding: Training is provided on a ""ask your co-worker"" basis and most of the people there are so protective of their skills that they will not share anything information with you. There is no onboarding training whatsoever. You are meant to just know their systems on the first day. This was my first job out of university and I was not given my induction or training. When we got a new software program and everyone was sent to an external training course and when I left the company a few months later, HR asked me to pay for the training. I had to escalate the issue to the Managing director and finally they said my contribution to the company far outweighed the costs of the training so I did not have to pay for it.

The funny thing was, when I left the company, they offered to give me a 30% pay rise and a promotion (while at the same time trying to get me to pay for the external training). Overall it was a poorly managed situation and it left a very bitter taste for me.Show More","I honestly believe TNS is a great company in other cities (I have heard from other colleagues that the UK, China and Perth (in Australia) offices are great so I only hope that things have improved in the Sydney office since I have left."
